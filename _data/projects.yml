    My very first foray into HTML5 canvas development with javascript. This game is 
    a combination of a block-matching game and a bullet dodging game, where the color 
    of the bullet that hits you drops down in the puzzle grid on the left. When you 
    connect three or more of the same color on the left, they disappear and you get 
    points.
