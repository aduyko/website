This one is cheating a little and technically started January 29th.

## Movies

### The Conversation (1974)
Somewhere in between Blow-Up and Le Samourai, a character study of an isolated man slowly realizing how little control he has over his own life. A movie about grief. I thought it was incredible. Hackman is excellent, portraying vulnerability and unease in a character who spends most of his time angry at, looking down on, or completely ignoring his friends and lovers. He is afraid to let anyone in, blaming himself for three deaths that likely resulted from his work: if he keeps himself isolated, he can control who gets hurt. Ideally, nobody ever again. But he is no god. He does not have this control. His friends and lovers feel alienated and unwanted by him. His worst fears about his work are validated in a way he did not - could not - predict. The film ends with his total unwillingness to process what had occured, a complete lack of growth. He is forced to face reality by an intrusive phone call; a reminder that he cannot shell himself off completely, that his actions will always have consequences, no matter how much he may wish otherwise, no matter how small he tries to make himself. We end with a broken man, his delusions of control shattered, playing the saxophone.

## Books

### Mitch Albom - For One More Day
TW: Suicide

I picked this book up at a community library (leave a book take a book type situation at my local coffee shop) on a whim. It is a hardcover with no sleeve and there's something I really like about how minimal hardcover books look without a sleeve. After I finished reading it I looked up the author and thought "Oh."

I guess this is Albom's entire deal: cheesy, moralizing stories about the importance of being good to the people you care about. This one's a much worse Christmas Carol where Scrooge is a failed baseball player. It's called a "philosophical novel" by Wikipedia, but that's a stretch. There's no philosophy here, just blanket statements about how you're going to regret not being nice to your mother. What a horrible little monster you are. How dare you ever have taken your mother for granted. And I mean, yeah, reading this made me think that I should call my parents more often. But so did this image: (TK).

If you try to read this as a novel instead of as a bunch of moralizing it's even worse. Benetto's tale begins after he has finished hurting everyone in his life: his mother is dead, his wife divorced him, his daughter cut him out of her life. There is nobody left. There is no Tiny Tim who is going to die if Benetto doesn't make any changes. He feels bad for himself and sees no reason to go on with life. What about his experience changes this? What does he learn that makes his life worth living? He cries about being a terrible son and tells his mother he misses her. Our Werther laments how wretched he is, how cruel his teenage self was to be embarassed by his poor saint of a mother. The melodrama is out of this world. And lament is all he does, because there's nothing he can do for a ghost. But this ghost wants him to live, and so he does.

We don't get to see any of his self-reflection or growth, anything that Benetto learns or does that leads to change. We never see him do any work, overcome any challenge. Albom skips the arduous task of writing a novel and tells us that after surviving, Benetto becomes an entirely new person: no longer suicidal, a beloved member of his community. Benetto needs only to think about his regrets, to agonize over imagined errors, and the narrator dutifully explains how his problems disappear. He is a child from beginning to end. The only conflict he gets involved in is colliding with and possibly killing a truck driver at the start of the novel. We gloss over this. His only interaction with anything real, the only part of this novel where his decisions might impact someone's life, the only part where we might have seen him DO something: totally forgotten. We skip straight to our fairy tale epilogue.

## Music

### Miki Matsubara - Miki Matsubara Best Collection
My friend Yusuf shared a link to the song "Mayonaka No Door / Stay With Me" and the first few seconds reminded me of the Bee Gees. Obviously I wanted more, which led me to this compilation album. The rest of the album is not as disco and gets hokey in some places but is fun and upbeat. Happy Thursday everyone.

### Miki Matsubara - WINK
The two TV shows that I vividly remember seeing (but not quite watching) shortly after my family immigrated to the United States were Full House and some cartoon that had Birdman in it. I also remember seeing a lot of commercials for Space Ghost, and wanting to watch it, because it was a cartoon, but never being able to catch the actual show. I didn't really speak or understand English so that might have been for the best. Not understanding English also kept me from getting what was going on in Full House, which, language aside, I thought was a show for grown ups because it was live action. There might be a lot I'm missing out on for never having understood Full House. Maybe if I knew enough English to "get" Full House I would now, as a fluent English-speaking adult, be able to engage with this album of 80's sitcom music.

Bob Saget, notorious dirty comic of Full House fame, released a comedy album in 2014 that was nominated for a Grammy Award. Jimmy Fallon won that award in 2013. I can only imagine the kind of person who decides they want to listen to a comedy album, and picks based on the Grammy awards. The only context I have ever heard comedy albums mentioned in is by older comedians talking about their favorite albums that they would play in the car. Aziz Ansari released a comedy album in 2020, and it was a contender for the Grammy. I guess the Grammys have un-cancelled him? He has finished doing his penance after being called out and taking time to reflect and grow or whatever he was doing?

It's also kind of interesting looking at which of these albums have their own articles and which don't. There's a bare-bones Wikipedia article for Lewis Black's 2006 grammy-winning album "The Carnegie Hall Performance". It contains two bits of trivia, one about a hidden track that you can get if you rewind the first track by eight minutes. Wikipedia does not say what is contained on the hidden track. Secret bonus jokes? A sincere message from the cold, bitter heart of Black himself? I had to look this up elsewhere, and found that it contains "Pre-show backstage noises and talking."

The wikipedia article also has a section on personnel, which includes the producer and sound engineers who worked on the album, people who I do not think are included in many album articles. The section was added in 2019 by "one of the longest-serving administrators on English Wikipedia." He has the following blurbs, with images of the associated medals, spread throughout his Wikipedia profile page:

> This editor is a Grandmaster Editor First-Class and is entitled to display this Mithril Editor Star with the Neutronium Superstar hologram.
> This editor is a Grand High Togneme Laureate and is entitled to display the Book of All Knowledge: 3rd Edition and attach the library barcode.
> This editor is a Grandmaster Administrator First-Class and is entitled to display this Gold Service Badge and carry the Silver Keys to the Encyclopedia.

Lots to think about here. Perhaps one day I will also be entitled to carry the Silver Keys to the Encyclopedia.

### Lemuria - Get Better
Alex Kerns wrote most of the songs on this album after his father died. He was able to share them with his bandmates, and felt comfortable with Sheena Ozzella singing his songs about his father's death. What must that have been like for both of them? What was that like when they were doing their ten year reunion tour for the album?

Dog is a beautiful beautiful song.

### Sonic Sea Turtles - Sound Pollution: Captain Spacey and His Search for a New Home

This band is sick, their recent singles rule, great emo/screamo/post-hardcore out of Minneapolis, check em out.

### Danzig - Danzig Sings Elvis
There's this guy, Viktor Longo, who has been making music for at least the past 10 years, some of it under the name VIKING. My friend Max showed me the song "Thunder at Midnight" on Myspace when we were in High School. The first few lyrics come to mind every now and again:
> Thunder at midnight
> I go for a drive
> I step on the gas now
> Just to know I'm alive
Last night for one reason or another I was on VIKING's bandcamp page, and the "If you like VIKING, you may also like" section included Danzig Sings Elvis. I'm not sure how they knew that I would be INCREDIBLY interested in Danzig Sings Elvis. But they knew.
I don't understand who this album is for. I'm sure Danzig had a lot of fun recording it. I don't think the heavier rock arrangements work well, and Danzig himself sounds kind of scratchy. I always imagine his voice sounding much more powerful in my head, I think that's what he does best. This album also does not include the best Elvis song, "Return to Sender," which should be instantly disqualifying.

### Ted Nguyent - Don't Vote
If you would like to know more about this band, listen to the song "Beach Anarchy" from this album, and then check out these three things I think cover everything else you need to know:
1. One of their Facebook posts: 
WELL GUYS WE PLAYED OUR BEST SET FIRST AT OUR LAST SHOW SORRY WE HAD TO DO IT LIKE THAT BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION MATT KLEIN FILMED THE WHOLE THING SO YOU CAN MAYBE WATCH IT IT'S BEEN WHAT IT'S BEEN AND WE'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED EVERYONE'S SUPPORT SO SORRY BUSH IS STILL PULLING THE STRINGS BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT THIS FUCKED UP WORLD WITH ROCK MUSIC

3. This website has a really good summary of this album under the section "Album": https://nuovoteatrodicuasso.it/Ted-Nguyent/Dont-Vote/73261

### Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell
The Trial by Franz Kafka is a gem of a book, an unfinished novel, preserved from destruction against the author's wishes. Thematically, it being unfinished works with it's message. The protagonist, Josef K., is stuck in an infinite loop of beaureocracy until he is suddenly and without warning executed. The unwritten part, the time between his ongoing trial and his execution, winds up being totally indeterminable. It could be a day, it could be twenty years. We don't know the same way K. doesn't know.

Not many books are published this way - post-modern books get away with the authors including themselves and containing meta-textual information, but that's done with authorial intent. We have Kafka's unfinished chapters and deleted passages against his wishes. The one good print edition (that I've been able to find) by Schocken Books contains:
- Unfinished chapters
- Passages deleted by Kafka
- Excerpts from Kafka's diaries
- Post-scripts by Max Brod, the man who was willed to destroy this material but preserved it
Of particular interest to me is the "Original version of the last sentences in the penultimate paragraph":
> ...were there arguments in his favor that had been overlooked? Of course there must be. Logic is doubtless unshakable, but it cannot withstand a man who wants to go on living. Where was the Judge? Where was the High Court of Justice? I have something to say. I lift up my hands.
The canonical text at the end of the penultimate paragraph is:
> ...were there arguments in his favor that had been overlooked? Of course there must be. Logic is doubtless unshakable, but it cannot withstand a man who wants to go on living. Where was the Judge whom he had never seen? Where was the high Court, to which he had never penetrated? He raised his hands and spread out all his fingers.
This is so incredible to me. Kafka was sick and suffering from tuberculosis while writing The Trial. There's an element of the autobiographical in all of his work; here it can be Josef K. stuck in a labyrinth of misery with no explanations around why or how to get out. There was nothing that could be done to treat tuberculosis at the time. He lived with the specter of death hanging over his shoulder. He did not know what would tie the middle of his novel (life) to the end (death), or how long it would last. The original text quoted above is the only time in the entire novel that the text shifts from third person to first person. It is not Josef K. raising his hands - it is I. It is Kafka. He could not accept death - he had something to say. But life is cruel, and no amount of pleading is enough to overcome the crushing machinations of reality that plod on around us, ceaseless and uncaring.

### N0THANKY0U - To the Fairest
There's an album somewhere out there of Japanese rave music where one of the songs is composed entirely of pitch shifted meows - like if the Nyan cat song had even more meowing. I found it when I was 12 on what I think was someone's personal website with a beige background. Everything was in Japanese, which is not a language I know, and I don't remember how I got there. At this point, the website and artist are probably lost for good. A shame.
