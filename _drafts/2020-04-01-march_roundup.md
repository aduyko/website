## Books

### Flow - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
It took me a couple of tries starting to read this and feeling frustrated and reading something else before I really sunk into it and started enjoying it. It definitely feels dated, both with cultural references and in writing style, but I think a lot of the substance holds up. I like the idea of having clear goals in your activities - it's something I've tried to do with figure drawing, and I think a lack of clear intention is a big part of why I have historically found it hard to stick to new activities. After the intitial hump of figuring out how to do something, I think it's really important to understand what you're trying to accomplish when you do something! I think framing it as a way of growing and becoming more complex as a person is also really appealing, and not something I can remember seeing in other psych/self-help type books. That being said, it seems like Csikszentmihalyi makes a lot of unsourced assumptions about human behavior, and it kind of feels like reading Foucalt. Sure, there's justification for some things, but I don't feel like the justification seems very trustworthy. If you don't agree with his premises, I don't think this book will really convince you otherwise. It also sets up a somewhat high-pressure expectation that you should never feel tired or need to decompress during your waking if you want to be the best version of yourself, which seems unhealthy. Despite its flaws, there's a lot in Flow that I agree with and that I can fit into my own mental model of how things work, and I'm thankful that I read it.

## Music

### Mike Lorenz & Friendz - Mike Lorenz & Friendz
I love jazz covers of rock songs and I love both of the bands being covered here. Jazz feels warm and familiar to me in general, so it's nice for that to be reinforced with interpretations of songs I've listened to a bunch anyway.

### The Drones - The Miller's Daughter
So sick. This is a compilation of 

### Violent Femmes - Hallowed Ground
I really like the Violent Femmes! I don't think they get a lot of exposure outside of their self titled debut (which is a really great album!!!) but I've enjoyed everything else I've heard by them - I listened to a few of their more recent tracks (They're still around!!! THEY RELEASED AN ALBUM LAST YEAR!!!) and I think those are really good too! It's not often you run across a band with a 30+ year career where you like their new stuff and their old stuff. That all aside, Hallowed Ground is a fun album. I have a huge soft spot for folk punk and anti folk and the like but that aside, I think they're a really interesting band who do a lot of really unusual stuff sonically and have very cool lyrics. I Hear the Rain is such a cool song. It slows down after the first few punkier tracks but I still think it's a worthwhile listen.

### Okean Elzy - Model
This is a nostalgic album for me - my dad would play music every morning on the weekends and it was a source of constant frustration when I wanted to sleep in as a teenager, but they've also all become very familiar songs and albums. I like listening to it now and I'm not sure how much of that is the comfort of familiarity and how much is the quality of the music. I like this album, and curiously, I find it a little more approachable than other Ukrainian music - I only understand Russian, which is not very similar, but I find Okean Elzy to be a little easier to wrap my head around. I like the tracks "Ya do tebe" and "Vstavai". I like this album more than the other one my dad would play regularly, Gloria.

### The Halo Benders - God Don't Make No Junk
I like this album a lot, it's reminiscent of early Modest Mouse stuff, which makes sense since they were contemporaries, and Doug Marscht and Calvin Johnson both knew about and admired them! I haven't listened to any of Johnson's other work but I like Built to Spill, and I feel like The Halo Benders are in a sweet spot of bringing a lot of ideas together with talented musicians and creating a really unique but familiar and welcoming sound. This is the only band I can think of that has two competing vocal tracks on every song, and it sounds great.

### The Halo Benders - Don't Tell Me Now
Another great album. It has a different energy compared to God Don't Make No Junk but is still fantastic.
