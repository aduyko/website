## Books

### Mahabharata - translated by William Buck
The William Buck translation is a condensed retelling of the Mahabharata and I really enjoyed it. It took a little bit to get into it and understand what was going on and who was who and why things were happening, but once I settled in I found it really fun and engaging. I enjoyed the frequent diversions into fables and the way that almost everything that happened had its own rich sphere of lore surrounding it. A wonderful epic retold in a captivating way.
