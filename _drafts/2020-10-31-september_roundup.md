## Movies

### I'm Thinking of Ending Things
I didn't love this as much as Synecdoche, New York or Eternal Sunshine. It's a lot subtler than Kaufman's other work and isn't constantly explaining itself to you, which I think kind of works given the larger overarching plot of what's happening, but I also feel like isn't quite up to the grand scale of his other work. It's a deeply unhappy person stuck inside their own head, sure, but coming out of it I didn't feel anything near what I felt with Synecdoche or Eternal Sunshine - it feels like a much shallower emotional story. This movie feels a little too smart for it's own good. It's peppered with references and allusions, large chunks of conversation are taken straight from various other sources, but they don't really add up to a greater whole. The magic happening throughout the movie and breaks from normal reality might have a deeper purpose but they wind up just being confusing and disorienting. Kaufman's work has centered around a few key themes like isolation and loneliness, and it seems like he adapted this story less on it's merits as a movie and more as a convenient vessel to cram in a bunch of his favorite references and explore his favorite ideas of isolation and loneliness. I dunno, it just feels very shallow compared to his other work - he presents the story as a suspenseful drama movie, where you're constantly thrown curve balls and trying to figure out what's going on instead of sitting you down with difficult emotional ideas, and he sneaks in a bunch of references to stuff he likes so that you can do homework later. Cool. It's not a very pretty movie either, everything is black or blue and super muted, and literally half of the movie is talking heads in a car with nothing in the background. I can see how that works given the plot and themes of the movie, but it's not really interesting to look at. All that being said, the ballet scene at the end is magnificent, but this movie seems like a pass unless you're a real Kaufman head.

## Music

### Marietta - Summer Death
Another incredible Marietta release. As It Were is a little more matured and polished but Summer Death is an absolutely solid Midwest Emo release. This is a bit more generic Midwest Emo sounding but still has some great tracks like Cinco de Mayo Shit Show and Chase, I Hardly Know Ya.

### Marietta - Cuts
An excellent, bite sized LP. The acoustic tracks are good, O.K., Mom is a great, super fun song.

### Desaparecidos - Read Music/Speak Spanish
Surprisingly, a Conor Oberst venture! I actually couldn't tell you what Bright Eyes sound like if you asked me but it's a name I'm aware of. As far as this goes, solid post-hardcore, although there's a lot of variety between the songs and I don't think it always works. The vocals are great and SOME of the guitar tones really work and kind of make me think of Weezer. I really hate some of the guitar tones and weird like. Vibraphone sounds. The songs with less of... that... are a lot better. I like the song Mañana. 

### Desaparecidos - Payola
This album has less weird sounds than Read Music/Speak Spanish, which I'm on board with. Does some interesting stuff and the guitars make me think of Muse, although I don't think that's a good comparison. There's a really interesting mishmash of sounds - like the song Von Maur Massacre, has the funky guitars and then a very classic punk rocky chorus. Also some of the lyrics get really corny lol like "Anonymous" but I think it's a nice throwback to the roots of punk with all the political messaging. On the whole though this is another solid album doesn't really stand out to me, but I could totally see other people liking it a lot more. 
For a fun treat, listen to the songs "Mañana" from Read Music/Speak Spanish and "10 Steps Behind" from this album back to back. Where does he get his ideas!

### American Football - American Football
This album is inescapable. The most famous house in the world! The opening riff of "Never Meant"! A very definitive (possibly THE most definitive? What's even a contender?) emo revival album. It's a little too post-rock-y and downtempo for me, I think it's just alright. There isn't enough passion and there aren't enough chugging guitars for me. That being said, I will love any references to the American Football house forever. Listening to this I'm reminded of something I read once about Sun Kil Moon, which is that it's a band for people who don't have enough Seratonin in their brains, and that sentiment comes to mind for me with American Football too. Maybe I would like them more if I felt worse. I think the song "Honestly?" is a jam with the groovy bass line until it becomes sad and boring like the rest of their songs.

### Parov Stelar - The Art of Sampling
The first track led me to look up when this album came out and when Random Access Memories by Daft Punk came out because it seemed like a track straight from the latter, if maybe a little less eager to push the boundaries. Past that though it's smooth sailing, the tracks are jazzy and groovy and probably great for dancing.

### Robo Pumpkin - Irresponsible Ghosts
Bedroom emo where the vocals remind me of King Krule at times. I think the music is fine, it didn't really stand out to me, but I'm super impressed by the bass chops and the fact that it's a one person act. Looking forward to more from them and seeing how the music evolves!

### Dogleg - Melee
Solid screamy indie rock but I found myself thinking that I'd rather be listening to Cloud Nothings or Pile. I love the gang vocals and the screaming is great, the dynamics just seem kind of wack, like every song is just at maximum volume/energy throughout. Maybe it's the drums, I dunno, but something about this album needs to chill out. The high energy screamy parts are really really well done, they're just relentless. Dogleg seem like they would have a really really fun live show.

### Dogleg - Dogleg
Their earlier LP, way more eased up and less maximal sounding than Melee! I like this album more than Melee, but it's also less unique sounding/distinctive - Melee is definitely a way more refined album and it's clear they want to go in a more fun/punchy direction. I like the track Calling Collect a lot. This band is just great at writing bops.

### The Starting Line - Say It Like You Mean It
Hey, this cover looks really familiar! Very generic pop-punky emo, not really sure why you would ever listen to this besides nostalgia. Every track is also 4 hours long and there are 100 tracks. Just listen to Blink-182 instead. 
I will say this grew on me as I listened to more of it but it seems unbearable if it's anything but background music.

### ...Who Calls So Loud - S/T
Extremely good drums and an overall pretty good emo/hardcore album! The songs are kind of long but they move around and take you places, the screaming is good, there are a lot of really interesting ideas and decisions in each song. It's kind of hard to sit through the whole thing because it's very abrasive and raw and the songs are on the long side, but it's worth a listen.

### A Great Big Pile of Leaves - You're Always On My Mind
I was just having a conversation with a coworker earlier today about music genre being a finnicky thing and some bands being associated with a genre based on them being in a certain place in a certain time, and that's what I think happend with AGBPOL. They have come up in my Spotify suggestions a bunch of times and I always just thought of them as indie rock. But I guess because they were coming onto the scene around the same time as other emo revival bands, some people lump them in? I don't buy that at all. I'm sure a lot of these songs have a good place on some sort of poppy indie playlist but the longer this album went on the worse I felt about it. Locus of Control is a nauseating song. Not a fan.

### Glocca Morra - Just Married
This album rules. Love the vocals, everything sounds great, really high energy, really snappy songs that cover a lot of ground, fun noodles, really fun overall. The little chiptune sounds are a unique addition that work really well within the really messy layered guitars and vocals. Y'All Boots Hats? rules and is such a great way to open up an album. It really unfortunately kind of drags around the middle until Me + Geniene, which is also a great track.

### Funeral Diner - Three Sides Dead
Indian Summer really did a number on the post-hardcore scene when you can tell exactly how the screaming will sound as soon as you hear a particular kind of twangy guitar opening up a song. This is a compilation album of all their tracks that were on splits, which I think is kind of unusual and kind of cool. There's a really nice feeling of balance between the violent moments of shredded guitar chords and strained shouts and the more relaxed sections surrounding them, and I think this is where Funeral Diner really shine. They don't wear you down and give you little breaks in between the really high energy, in your face sections, but are interesting to listen to throughout. This compilation album is great. It doesn't get stale, each track is really good and different enough to stay interesting, the album isn't so agressive that it's impossible to have on in the background. Really really great.

### Funeral Diner - Swept Under
This album is so cool. Funeral Diner seem like they were evolving in a similar way to Unwound and really pushing the boundaries of their music and of musical genre in general before they broke up. Really incredible stuff, way less "standard" sounding than the (well done! but standard nevertheless) emotive hardcore stuff from Three Sides Dead - lot's of really unusual and interesting musical decisions and directions and they sound fantastic. Borne Upon My Shield and Under are really great tracks. I don't think the last 2 are as good but they're not bad.

### Sediment Club - Stucco Thieves
Another band featuring a high school acquaintance! I don't listen to a lot of noise in general, and this veers a bit into like... no wave? type stuff, but this is a super rad album. Cobalt Ruin is a really great track, but they're all really groovy and way more... melodic? harmonious? Than they initially appear. Honestly I was really surprised to find myself liking this as much as I did given my history with similar music - I'm excited to listen to more.

### Beach Boys - Pet Sounds
A very good album, it deserves the recognition it gets. I'm always really shocked by how simple and poignant the lyrics are in these groundbreaking 60's albums like this and the stuff the Beatles were putting out around the same time.

### Decay - Staring At The Sun
Kinda alt-rocky, kinda just a big wall of sound without anything really distinct or interesting, kinda just a boring album. Makes me think of Three Days Grace with slightly more emo sensibilities. Also the songs are all so long! They're all like 5 minutes long, but they don't really put that time to use. I liked the song "Misery" the most, it feels like they're so close to being something I would really like. They just don't quite click for me.

### Heroin - Heroin
The roots! Punchy, to-the-point hardcore songs with a lot of variety and great screaming. The production has a really low-fi feel which I like hearing for hardcore bands. A screamier Minor Threat with quieter vocals, if you will. Leave is a really cool song. I definitely see myself coming back to this album, it fills a really interesting niche between hardcore and post-hardcore.

### 17° Below - Nothing Matters
Is this band for real having a degree sign in their name. It makes their music a real hassle to find anywhere. That on it's own is disqualifying. That aside, pretty run of the mill pop punk, sounds like music you might hear on the radio, nothing particularly inspiring. I stopped listening halfway through.

### Soulside - Less Deep
Some good old DC hardcore. A solid hardcore album, less agressive and a little easier to listen to/just throw on casually than some other hardcore bands. They get funky and do something interesting with a lot of their songs too, Dreams is a great track and a step removed from being a post-punk song, In Days to Come is a really cool track that also sounds pretty different while still clearly being hardcore.

### Soulside - Soon Come Happy
I think it's great that these old hardcore records are still available but wish they were being shared in some way other than compilation albums - I can't imagine there are a lot of people who really enjoy or have a good time with 20 track long albums. I wish I could tell which parts of this compilation album came from where, I feel like there's a shift from Name In Mind to Problems Faced When Traveling, and then again from Punch the Geek to Clifton Wall. Alright I looked it up, Baby -> Forgiveness was an EP, then Bass -> Otherside was a single, then God City to the end was an LP. The vocals sound different, the songs all feel very different. I feel like they should be discussed seperately instead of lumped together like this, but here we are. That being said, I think Soulside were great and did a lot of really unique and interesting sounding stuff. The Trigger EP is still very rooted in classic hardcore sounds but does a lot of sonically interesting stuff and has a lot of varation and is a really cool EP. Bass\*103 is similar to Trigger. Hot Bodi Gram starts getting way out there and is very different, a huge movement in a post-hardcore direction. The vocals are more gravelly and strained, the music more sparse and desolate. It's my least favorite part of the compilation - they were obviously growing and changing, but I don't think this direction really worked.

### Funeral Diner - The Underdark
A more post-rocky direction for this post-hardcore band and I think it works really well. I love the long, slow guitar build ups to the breakdowns and cascades of loudness and anger and misery crashing down. Really great stuff, I found myself thinking "hell yes" multiple times while listening. The drumming on this album is really outstanding. I think the weakest moments are peaks when the guitars are all playing while the singer is screaming, and that the moments when they ease off a bit and play more melodically are way better, but they create so many beautiful sounds on this album that it's easy to overlook when it doesn't quite work. Really majestic tracks, really glad I found out about this band and listened to them. The album is great but I especially liked every track starting with "It's Good That We Never Met", the insanely good transition into "Two Houses", and every track through the end of the album.
