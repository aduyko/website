I've been listening to a LOT of emo the past couple of months with the idea of making a tier list but I haven't been documenting any of that effort and also haven't really wanted to take the dive and do the work. I'll try to start writing about those albums here but I think now I have to listen to them again, even the ones I didn't like, and I'm not looking forward to that.

## Music

### Niiice. - Never Better
The exact kind of screaming I like to hear in my contemporary (4th wave?) emo. They seem like they would be great live. Cool EP, but something about it doesn't feel like it totally adds up - looking forward to see where these guys go in the future.

### Niiice. - Try to Stay Positive
I listened to this album which came out before the above EP after writing that above blurb and thinking how I'd like to hear more by this band!!! I think it's a great album and I like it more than Never Better. I like the little skit in one of the songs (I've never heard a mid-album skit I didn't like) and the musical variation between and within songs. Easy to listen to, great screaming, great album. RVR WTR is my favorite track on the album.

### The Beths - Future Me Hates Me
Great album, my favorite type of indie pop. Feels fresh and familiar at the same time. Not Running is a fantastic song - I think their songs where they experiment a bit more are really strong, like Not Running and Little Death.

### Papayer - Something Good
I didn't really like listening to this. I guess it's fine to have on in the background. It's more downbeat and meandering than I like my music.

### Oolong - About Your Imaginary Friend
This album is incomprehensible to me. The sounds all kind of mash together and don't seem to totally work. Instruments and vocals begin and start at weird times and everything feels really inconsistent throughout each song. The ballady Miller's High Life made me feel unwell. I wanted to skip each track halfway through. The album gets a lot better starting with the track "Rick Murphy". Overall though I really didn't like listening to this and it activaly made me feel bad.

### Burial Etiquette - Burial Etiquette
This reminds me of Breakwater or Indian Summer, 90s emo/screamo, and Slint with the really quiet mixing on the vocals. I think it works really really well, I love the sound and I feel like you still get the punch of the screamy vocals without them becoming overbearing. I fell in love with this album instantly. I looked up everything else they've done (Flowers for a Broken Machine single, He Who Walks Behind the Rose single) and loved those too. Incredible.

### Hum - Cloud City
I feel like Hum are an important band that I never really got into. I was really surprised to find out they released an album in June, and just as surprised that I wasn't that into it. Shoegaze isn't my favorite genre and nothing about this album really stood out to me. I listened to the first half of it while cooking breakfast and wasn't very into it, and listened to the second half while figuring out how to sculpt with clay and liked it a lot as background music. This album seems like its somewhere between stoner metal and post rockand that seems like a tricky sound to pull off. When it works I love it though - the tracks "The Summoning" and "Shapeshifter" were my favorites.

### Elephant Jake - Andy Finally Lost the War With the Disco Beat
This was a pretty good emo album. They try a lot of interesting stuff out and there are a lot of weird and varied sounds, and I think the vocalist sounds unique. It unfortunately just didn't particularly resonate with me, but I think it's worth a listen.

### Pet Symmetry - Pets Hounds
I liked this in the same way I like Motion City Soundtrack. They have a particular energy and the vocalist sounds a particular way that's very reminiscent of like 00's pop emo. I don't think I like them as much as MCS (whether that's just nostalgia speaking or not) but I'm going to check out their other work as well.

### Built To Spill - Perfect From Now On
This was a very weird album! The songs are all over the place! It sounds great, in parts, but you never really get to feel comfortable with any of it. Some of the parts sound really really good though - I think the second half of "I Would Hurt a Fly" and the first half of "Untrustable" are really cool.

### Built To Spill - The Normal Years
Slightly more consistent within a single track but still a really strange album. Compared to Perfect From Now On, The Normal Years IS a bit more normal and sounds a bit more like traditional rock, but still does a lot of really unusual stuff. I liked this album a lot more than Perfect From Now On. I also really liked all the songs about relationships and breakups! Some Things Last a Long Time and Girl were both really great tracks.

### Usko & Urheilu - Eristysnauha
Not my cup of tea and none of the tracks really stood out to me except for "Puplik Enemi" which I thought was cool and kind of reminded me of Tyler the Creator.

### Madvillain - Madvillainy
This album was fine. I remember thinking it was great when I listened to it when I was younger but nothing about it stood out to me this time besides for the track "All Caps" which rules. The production is great and the album sounds really good, it's just not for me. I would probably really enjoy hearing it while out and about.

### Joyce Manor - S/T
One of my absolute favorite albums that I've listened to a whole bunch, just wanted to record it here for posterity. I love this album. Fantastic high energy punky emo. The only problem I have with it is that it's too short haha! I want more.

### Joyce Manor - Never Hungover Again
Another of my favorite albums. The songs are more complex than their S/T even though they're all still ~2 minutes long, and they rule.

### Joyce Manor - Cody
The Joyce Manor album I don't like. Cody sounds like a middling alt rock album without any of the energy or punch of their prior releases. "Stairs" sounds like a Hoobastank song. Nothing inspiring here.

### Joyce Manor - Million Dollars to Kill Me
Another alt-rocky album that I'm not very into. I feel the same about this one as I do about Cody.

### Joyce Manor - Songs From Northern Torrance
This is like a demo album? I like it, it's a return to their roots, but it's hard to know how to feel about a "rarities compilation" where half of the album appears on other albums. It's nice to hear some of the acoustic demos and it's a fun album to listen to but probably not one I'll return to unless there's something specific I'm looking for.

### Joyce Manor - Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired
I like this album but not as much as S/T or Never Hungover Again. It's nice to see how their sound evolved from this album to the next and how they returned to this kind of unrefined sound with their latest rarities album. This album is a little unfocused I think with the exception of some really good tracks like If I Needed You There. They definitely find that focus/punchyness in S/T. I like the cover of Video Killed the Radio Star, but I'm generally a sucker for covers.
