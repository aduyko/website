I've been listening to a LOT of emo the past couple of months with the idea of making a tier list but I haven't been documenting any of that effort and also haven't really wanted to take the dive and do the work. I'll try to start writing about those albums here but I think now I have to listen to them again, even the ones I didn't like, and I'm not looking forward to that.

## Music

### Niiice. - Never Better
The exact kind of screaming I like to hear in my contemporary (4th wave?) emo. They seem like they would be great live. Cool EP, but something about it doesn't feel like it totally adds up - looking forward to see where these guys go in the future.

### Niiice. - Try to Stay Positive
I listened to this album which came out before the above EP after writing that above blurb and thinking how I'd like to hear more by this band!!! I think it's a great album and I like it more than Never Better. I like the little skit in one of the songs (I've never heard a mid-album skit I didn't like) and the musical variation between and within songs. Easy to listen to, great screaming, great album. RVR WTR is my favorite track on the album.

### The Beths - Future Me Hates Me
Great album, my favorite type of indie pop. Feels fresh and familiar at the same time. Not Running is a fantastic song - I think their songs where they experiment a bit more are really strong, like Not Running and Little Death.

### Papayer - Something Good
I didn't really like listening to this. I guess it's fine to have on in the background. It's more downbeat and meandering than I like my music.

### Oolong - About Your Imaginary Friend
This album is incomprehensible to me. The sounds all kind of mash together and don't seem to totally work. Instruments and vocals begin and start at weird times and everything feels really inconsistent throughout each song. The ballady Miller's High Life made me feel unwell. I wanted to skip each track halfway through. The album gets a lot better starting with the track "Rick Murphy". Overall though I really didn't like listening to this and it activaly made me feel bad.

### Burial Etiquette - Burial Etiquette
This reminds me of Breakwater or Indian Summer, 90s emo/screamo, and Slint with the really quiet mixing on the vocals. I think it works really really well, I love the sound and I feel like you still get the punch of the screamy vocals without them becoming overbearing. I fell in love with this album instantly. I looked up everything else they've done (Flowers for a Broken Machine single, He Who Walks Behind the Rose single) and loved those too. Incredible.
