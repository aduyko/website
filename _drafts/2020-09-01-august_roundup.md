I've been listening to a LOT of emo the past couple of months with the idea of making a tier list but I haven't been documenting any of that effort and also haven't really wanted to take the dive and do the work. I'll try to start writing about those albums here but I think now I have to listen to them again, even the ones I didn't like, and I'm not looking forward to that.

## Music

### Niiice. - Never Better
The exact kind of screaming I like to hear in my contemporary (4th wave?) emo. They seem like they would be great live. Cool EP, but something about it doesn't feel like it totally adds up - looking forward to see where these guys go in the future.
