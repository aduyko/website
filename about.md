I'm Andriy Duyko, a New York based developer/devops engineer. I've spent the last year away from tech, focusing primarily on painting and creating art - you can check out some of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aduyko){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I led DevOps at [Group Nine Media](https://www.groupninemedia.com){:target="_blank"}.

I love to read, watch movies, and paint.

If you have any questions or comments shoot me an e-mail at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
