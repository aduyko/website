I'm Andriy Duyko, a New York based engineering leader/developer/devops engineer. I am currently working at [Rearc](https://www.rearc.io/){:target="_blank"} as an engineering manager, with responsibilities spanning from leading company-wide goal-setting to managing our internal data platform team to overseeing our pre-sales and CRM process. Outside of tech, I have spent time focusing on painting and creating art - you can check out some of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aduyko){:target="_blank"}.

I love to read, watch movies, and paint.

If you have any questions or comments shoot me an e-mail at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
