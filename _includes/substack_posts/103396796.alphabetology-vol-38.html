<h3>Books</h3><p>The House of Mirth - Edith Wharton<br>The Savage Detectives - Roberto Bolaño</p><h3>Movies</h3><p>Her</p><h3>Music</h3><p></p><div><hr></div><h2>Books</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Sudden Death*</strong></h3><p>This is a post-modern book about Anne Boleyn, tennis, the arts, the Catholic Church, the late renaissance, and the conquest of the Aztec empire. It’s really good.</p><h3><strong>Anna Karenina</strong></h3><p>What a way to begin a book - Prince Stepan Arkadievitch Oblonsky wakes up in pajamas, rubbing his big belly and yawning contentedly, before snapping to, thinking “oh my god,” and remembering that he’s in the dog house for cheating on his wife. It’s really funny! And the first third or so (half? maybe?) builds up a lot of fragile relationships and tense situations and is very engaging. And then we devolve into these fragile relationships and tense situations turning into absolute torment for everyone involved, expressed entirely internally. Everyone is screaming the screams of a person burned by a thousand suns. Most of all the eponymous Anna Karenina herself, but she isn’t really the focus of the book past the halfway point as much as Tolstoy’s self-insert Levin, a philosopher-landowner who doesn’t like the hoity-toity city folk and prefers getting down and dirty with the farmers, who he kind of hates too.</p><p>There’s a lot of internal torment to relate to - concerns about saying or doing the wrong thing, about losing someone close to you, about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, about bad luck, about money. Anna Karenina (the novel, not the character) does a really fantastic job showing how these awful negative thought cycles can perpetuate themselves and grind you down and ruin not just your life, but the life of the people you love as well.</p><p>Tolstoy’s answer to this inevitable suffering, is, of course, God. It’s an answer Levin reaches very quickly (after 600 pages of hemming, hawing, grasping, meandering - commenting on how simple the answer was all along, and how much time had been wasted in deep thought) in the epilogue. However you take this conclusion, there’s certainly a kind of suffering arising from obsessive thought. Who knows what the answer to that is.</p><h3><strong>Absalom, Absalom!</strong></h3><p>I like Faulkner, I think he really got a lot of mileage out of writing 20 books about the decay of the post-civil war south, I think he really draws you into his worlds and keeps you trapped with hundreds of disjoint ideas wrapping around you like a snake, I think he really keeps you trapped in Absalom, Absalom! by telling you the same story over and over and over and slightly unfurling what happens, like a mystery, but really simmering in just how inexorable and how recursive and how unstoppable a story can be, how men become myths, how myths fade away, how stories are told and retold, and how everything about this book is laid out flat right from the start:</p><blockquote><p>Or perhaps that’s it: they dont explain and we are not supposed to know. We have a few old mouth-to-mouth tales, we exhume from old trunks and boxes and drawers letters without salutation or signature, in which men and women who once lived and breathed are now merely initials or nicknames out of some now incomprehensible affection which sounds to us like Sanskrit or Chocktaw, we see dimly people, the people in whose living blood and seed we ourselves lay dormant and waiting, in this shadowy attenuation of time possessing now heroic proportions, performing their acts of simple passion and simple violence, impervious to time and inexplicable——Yes, Judith, Bon, Henry, Sutpen: all of them. They are there, yet something is missing; they  are like a chemical formula exhumed along with the letters  from that forgotten chest, carefully, the paper old and faded and falling to pieces, the writing faded, almost indecipherable, yet meaningful, familiar in shape and sense, the name and presence of volatile and sentient forces; you bring them together in the proportions called for, but nothing happens;  you re-read, tedious and intent, poring, making sure that  you have forgotten nothing, made no miscalculation; you bring them together again and again nothing happens: just the words, the symbols, the shapes themselves, shadowy inscrutable and serene, against that turgid background of a horrible and bloody mischancing of human affairs.  </p></blockquote><p>Absalom is a challenging read, and I can’t say I enjoyed reading it, but I think a lot about it is going to stick with me, and that’s always worthwhile.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Movies</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Her</strong></h3><p>This movie really surprised me! I did NOT want to see it, because I have opinions about AI, but it was much less about the AI and much more about relationships. I didn’t expect this to end the way it did, it was way more fun than I expected for such a sad movie. It has a very somber tone, but there’s a lot going on in between the slow, pensive moments. <br><br>Everyone in this wears very funny pants.</p><h3><strong>Minority Report*</strong></h3><p>Way cooler and more fun than I thought it would be, way less campy than other Spielberg movies like E.T. or Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park. The futuristic elements of this have aged really well and still seem futuristic today, the philosophical undertones are there (arresting people before they commit murder!) but aren’t overwhelming or boring, and Tom Cruise does Tom Cruise things.</p><h3><strong>Hail, Caesar!</strong></h3><p>I liked this a lot right up until the end, at which point it is revealed that the movie is less of a cohesive whole and more of a bunch of really fun vignettes tied together by a central character. It’s a movie about Hollywood and the film industry, but much lighter and less pessimistic than Barton Fink. Take that as you will. Channing Tatum’s dance number is really really good.</p><h3><strong>Sunset Boulevard</strong></h3><p>Another movie about Hollywood!!! Everyone on earth seems to really love this movie, it didn’t do the trick for me. Maybe it’s been too influential and seems tired because I’ve seen its echoes in every single movie since.</p><h3><strong>Arrival*</strong></h3><p>I first saw this four years ago and I can’t remember if I cried that time or not. I did cry this time. Ostensibly, this is a movie about aliens and communication, but it expands and balloons into something more like Malick’s Tree of Life* in the last twenty minutes and becomes so much more. Sporadic dream-like sequences throughout the movie come together and answer an important question with the simple, “Of course. Every single time, of course.” Really really great movie.<br><br>* Conceptually, of course. It does not turn into a full-on abstract art piece like Tree of Life.</p><h3><strong>It Follows</strong></h3><p>It certainly follows! This movie is stressful and tense and about anything you want it to be about, which I think is a strength and a weakness. It makes it very easy to relate to the movie and create opinions about it, thats for sure. A great movie to talk about with your friends. I didn’t think this was as good as the hype that led me to it, but it was a good watch.</p><h3><strong>She’s All That</strong></h3><p>It’s fine, very 90s high school romcom, but you should watch <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> instead.</p><h3><strong>Sabrina (1954)</strong></h3><p>They were still calling these types of movies “comedic romances” in newspapers, that’s how fresh the rom-com genre was. It’s a product of its time, but my big takeaway - poor Sabrina! Given no agency throughout, pulled around and manipulated by everyone in her life up to the very very end. Hardly a happy ending.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Music</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Cold Room Heady</strong></h3><p>Very bedroom jam session vibes - relatable music that I hear myself in, as a musician. Bedroom recordings Alex G with some zany, fun electronic stuff thrown in. Unfortunately, as relatable as that is, as much as I can see myself as Cold Room Heady, I think it has the same failings that my own music does, in that it isn’t really that fun for people who don’t know me to listen to. It’s definitely emo, it’s just missing a certain “<em>oomph</em>.” The album Spacial Hydration starts to do some cool stuff but something about it doesn’t totally sit right with me and I just can’t engage with it the way I would like to.</p><p>Aside: There was something I listened to recently that made me think of Home is Where and the kind of Dylan-y inspired vocals and I don’t think it was Cold Room Heady but who else could it have been.</p><h3><strong>Komusō</strong></h3><p>It’s japanese hardcore! The earlier stuff is fun, I think the later stuff is a little too screamy and I like my hxc more proggy but what can you do.</p><h3><strong>medukha</strong></h3><p>My friends are in this band and their music has a psych rock-y groove that feels just like coming home and slipping on a pair of well-familiar slippers.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have a great day.</p>
