<p>Hello. I haven’t had a lot of time to sit down and work through my thoughts about a lot of these books and movies,, so you’ll have to settle, unfortunately, for some sparse thoughts, particularly about the movies.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Books</h3><p>The Sympathizer*<br>To Kill a Mockingbird*<br>Bad Blood*<br>Range: Why Generalists Triumph In a Specialized World<br>The Melancholy of Resistance*<br></p><h3>Movies</h3><p>10 Things I Hate About You*<br>Godfather*<br>Godfather Part II<br>Elf<br>The Nightmare Before Christmas*<br>The Batman<br>My Big Fat Greek Wedding*<br>West Side Story (2021)<br>Pig<br>The Wedding Singer<br>To Kill a Mockingbird</p><div><hr></div><h2>Books</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>The Sympathizer* - Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong></h3><p>I liked this. It felt very bleak and it made war and politics feel awful, as they should.</p><h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird* - Harper Lee</strong></h3><p>This read a lot more like Tom Sawyer or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn than I expected it to? There’s a lot of just being a kid and hanging out and growing up and seeing how people change and how the world changes, and noticing yourself change along with everything else. This was a really really fun read and also very good. Great.</p><h3><strong>Bad Blood* - John Carreyrou</strong></h3><p>I knew Theranos was an absolute nightmare, and I’d read a bunch of stuff about how their promises were crazy, and about how Elizabeth Holmes touted that she drew a diagram of a time machine when she was 5 as some sign of her inventorial might. This is my favorite part of the entire Theranos scandal, that I think about sometimes:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg" width="520" height="479.17874396135267" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:763,&quot;width&quot;:828,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:56711,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Balwani: \&quot;OK\&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Balwani: &quot;OK&quot;" title="Balwani: &quot;OK&quot;" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58abda3-4242-4c8e-b39a-4def64bc48b8_828x763.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I did NOT know how much of a nightmare it was on the inside. Or about the honestly baffling persuasive prowess of Holmes. This was a fun read, and I’m sure it’s insanely biased, but the company was horrible and I’m not sure how much value there is in trying to redeem them with more sympathetic perspectives. They defrauded innocent people regarding their health.</p><h3><strong>Range: Why Generalists Triumph In a Specialized World - David Epstein</strong></h3><p>This book is a stinker!!!!!!!!!! It’s pop psych. Prepare to read dozens of anecdotes about the most impressive people in the universe, and how you should be like them. Prepare to learn that virtuoso musicians have the kind of mental flexibility that it takes to switch from acoustic guitar to electric guitar.</p><p>I think there are a lot of genuinely interesting ideas that Epstein presents, and there are things he brings up that I would like to incorporate more into my life, but as a package this book sucks. Its 200 pages or whatever repeating “It’s good to try doing a lot of different stuff,” with a smattering of interesting anecdotes and then the most inane thing you have read in your life to back those ideas up.</p><p>It is absolutely insane to me that art is used as a category of thing that Epstein considers a good example of how a wide range of experiences can contribute. I don’t even want to write more about it.<br></p><h3><strong>The Melancholy of Resistance* - László Krasznahorkai</strong></h3><p>We start off with a rowdy bunch of Hungarian peasants whomst smell like sausage and are farting and burping on a train car and the immense terror this causes poor Ms. Plauf, we follow pages and pages of neverending sentences of Mr Eszter thinking about how the light reflects off of all of the garbage in the streets, we learn about the cosmos, we learn about authoritarian might. Paranoia ebbs and flows as nothing good happens, first in theory, later very agressively in reality. What more do you want.</p><p></p><h2>Movies</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>10 Things I Hate About You*</strong></h3><h3><strong>The Godfather*</strong></h3><p>It’s a classic. There’s nothing better than hearing the famous “Godfather Theme” when they’re in Italy.</p><h3><strong>The Godfather Part II</strong></h3><p>I thought I had seen this already but I hadn’t. Did not like this as much as part one, sorry to say,</p><h3><strong>Elf</strong></h3><h3><strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas*</strong></h3><p>There was a tweet or something a while ago about how something as twisted as a black pointy spiral could only come from the mind of Tim Burton, and it’s true. Nobody else has done it since. This movie was a blast, lots of fun, looks fantastic, great music. I was shocked to learn that Danny Elfman is the voice of Jack Skellington.</p><h3><strong>The Batman</strong></h3><p>The first half of this was a lot of fun but then it started to really drag!!! I’m a big Robert Pattinson guy but not a fan of this movie!</p><h3><strong>My Big Fat Greek Wedding*</strong></h3><p>This movie rules</p><h3><strong>West Side Story (2021)</strong></h3><p>I liked this just fine although I’m told the 1961 movie is much better. The dancing was very cool, to me.</p><h3><strong>Pig</strong></h3><p>This was fine, although I thought the ending was a little bit too much with the dinner. The whole movie was a little heavy handed, I don’t think the makers had a lot of faith in their audience.</p><h3><strong>The Wedding Singer</strong></h3><h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong></h3><p>I watched this right after reading the book and I thought the book was a lot better, sorry to say,, although the movie is fine too.</p><p>— — — — — —</p><p>Have a great day</p>
