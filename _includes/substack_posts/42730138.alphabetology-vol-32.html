I don’t really think you get much development of Max as a character compared to, say, The Road Warrior, but I also don’t really think it matters; this doesn’t really feel like it’s Max’s story the way that Road Warrior is. It’s kind of funny to me to imagine the Mad Max franchise turning into something like The Fast and the Furious with 10000 movies that are just extended car chases. Hell, why not. It’s way more stylish, has more character, and is faster paced than anything in the F&amp;F series.</p><p>I do think it’s very funny that it sounds like Max’s (played by Tom Hardy) speech is sped up. Lots of very fun/cool stylistic choices in this movie.<br><br></p><h3><strong>Alejandro G. Iñárritu - Birdman (2014)</strong></h3><p>This is one of my favorite movies I’ve ever seen. It’s really incredibly conceived and directed, everything about it seems deliberate and is perfect. Every character is just oozing, spilling their entire deal, and we sit back and watch what happens as everything goes wrong, and how our characters deal with that. The meta aspects of the film are also outstanding and really tie it together so well. The line between the play within the movie and the movie itself is nonexistant. The dialogue is theatrical, the single take cinematography is akin to being at the theater. It’s the best play I’ve ever seen.</p><p>Thematically, Birdman is a little like the hit tv show Curb Your Enthusiasm, as an exploration of selfishness and self-obsession. Except I have trouble with Curb, it stresses me out too much. With Curb I think it’s really obvious how Larry is going to get into a sticky situation and it’s a lot of tension waiting for him to get caught and not know how to face the consequences. Birdman is also a very tense movie, but in a very different way. There are no Chekov’s guns immediately pointed at anyone’s head. It’s a theatrical cast just doing normal people kind-of-bad stuff and living with the consequences, which do or do not occur at the whims of the gods. Their problems are entirely their own to deal with, the climax is so much more than a mirror reading “you do bad things because you are selfish.”</p><p>And maybe that’s not an accurate statement to make. Our protagonist, Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton, who, upon reading the script, asked if it was a joke being played on him — very very cool casting) is constantly surrounded by reminders that everything he is doing is out of vanity. His lines in his play are a constant reminder of his self-obsession. His hallucinations are all about his success and failure. He’s a Walter White who never makes the leap to self-confrontation. The stress in Curb Your Enthusiasm comes from Larry David having to confront his own actions and feel guilt — Riggan never thinks about anyone other than himself. He is without shame. He turns any conversation anyone tries to have with him into a conversation about him. And through sheer force of will, he finds the best ending he could have wished for.</p><p>I love this movie so so much. Please watch it.</p><div><hr></div><h2>TV</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Squid Game</strong></h3><p>Quick summary: This is fun to watch but the characterization gets so sloppy in the final episodes that I think this isn’t really a <em>good</em> show.</p><p>All the media buzz I think has more to do with the novelty than anything else, death game is a huuuuge genre that I think many people just haven’t been exposed to. The hit video game series Danganronpa is a death game. There are a ton of manga/anime that are death games. They all keep you hooked and are a blast to experience: You really want to know what happens to who and the tension doesn’t let up until the end. But other series I think really lean into their characters, and I don’t think Squid Game goes far enough.</p><p>Fundamentally, death game media is about presenting a bunch of different philosophies and seeing what happens when they clash in a life or death situation. You have all sorts of people from all different walks of life doing what makes sense to them to try to survive. Will brute force come out on top? Compassion? Cold calculation? That’s what we’re really watching when we watch Squid Game. And the moral theater put on by Squid Game sucks.</p><p>Spoiler warning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Skip down to “Music” or something. Or close this newsletter if you do NOT want to be spoiled!!!!!</p><p>Seong Gi-hun is a degenerate gambler who steals from his grandmother. It’s beyond me where his moral high-ground comes from as the show progresses. When the whole meaning of the show lies in the characters, I think it helps for them to do things that make sense. It’s a show about how people interact!!!!! And Seong Gi-hun, after killing 10 people in Tug-of-War, participating in the big brawl night, “tricking” an old man (killing him!!!! KILLING HIM!!!!!) in a game of marbles, and seeing over 400 people die, as a participant in a game where people die, decides in the last two episodes that killing people in the games is going too far. Get the fuck out of here. Bad! Bad!!!!!!!! Don’t even try with this “he’s only against unnecessary killing” or whatever. “Oh now that 400 other people have died, I realize that this game turns people into monsters, and I’m against that.” Be honest with yourself here. That’s a way more complicated idea than what we are shown in the 20 minutes of TV between the bridge game and the ending. It doesn’t make sense.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg" width="780" height="470" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:470,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41484,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30635ce8-3824-4d9f-bef6-36e22af93d2a_780x470.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">I bet if you replaced all of his dialogue with “duhhhh, buhhhhh” you wouldn’t lose anything meaningful.

People in the Squid Game chose to participate. He killed someone who had no choice through his selfishness) I think it kind of makes sense that the ending is a wet fart. It’s impossible for it to be good. He is the dumbest guy on Earth, who nobody wants to root for. How is this our protagonist, when literally everyone else has clear goals and motivations. You can make up whatever you want about this show, not by virtue of it attempting to be some post-modern commentary, but by virtue of our protagonist being poorly written. In your own words, please tell me what he believes in. What his play in the game means, what his win means. There’s nothing. It has no legs to stand on.</p><p>And it’s a shame! Everything up until the final game is really good and fun! It’s very cool seeing behind the scenes in a death game, that usually doesn’t happen, and it’s cool that there’s a lot of intrigue and dysfunction there. There are a lot of intriguing questions left unanswered, the character archetypes are laid out really clearly, they interact with each other really really well (the marble episode is incredible! really the star of the series), there’s a strong element of social commentary. It just completely falls on its ass at the end.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Music</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Pantera - Cowboys From Hell (Thrash)</strong></h3><p>I can’t believe this album title. It’s like what a five year old would think was cool. What’s cool? Cowboys. Let’s get someone to juice this idea a bit… what if they’re from hell too. Outstanding. The album’s fine.</p><h3><strong>* Moondog - Moondog 2 (Experimental, World)</strong></h3><p>Moondog rules, really really beautiful percussion.</p><div><hr></div><p>Ok that’s all for these past couple of weeks.
