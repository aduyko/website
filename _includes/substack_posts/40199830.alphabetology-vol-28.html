<p>Sorry for skipping last week. My footnotes about The Green Knight are very good so make sure to check them out.</p><p>———————</p><h3>Movies</h3><h3><strong>* The Green Knight (2021)</strong></h3><h3><strong>Cool Hand Luke (1967)<br><br></strong></h3><h3>Music</h3><h4><strong>* Electric Light Orchestra<br>Cold Room Heady<br>Lucius<br>* Testament<br><br></strong></h4><h2>Movies</h2><p>———————</p><h3><strong>* David Lowery - The Green Knight (2021)</strong></h3><p>Spoilers!</p><p>I really came around on this movie after writing about it below, and I think it’s very good now. I didn’t think this before I wrote the below.</p><p>The strongest reaction I have to this movie is that it’s not the story of Gawain and the Green Knight. [1] It’s the story of “Garwin” and the Green Knight. It’s the story of a layabout, a wastrel of a man who does nothing but get drunk, and the journey he is pushed into. The story of Gawain is a story showcasing and extolling knightly chivalry, an inside look into the mind of a man doing his best to navigate challenging situations in a chivalrous way. The story of Garwin is a story of a man-child being kicked and dragged onto, not even knightliness itself, but merely the path towards knightliness.</p><p>And on those merits, it’s a fine movie. It looks really pretty and sounds great. It’s mysterious and atmospheric and you’re pulled into Garwin’s sufferings and tribulations. He’s clearly no hero, constantly pushed around and making it to the end of his journey by the skin of his teeth. Honestly it’s unclear how much of his journey he would even be capable of making without literal magical intervention: things that were lost conveniently reappear. He is guided by a magical fox. You get the impression that the entire ordeal, which seems like it was organized by the witching of his mother, is being overseen by her. She wants her son to be something better.</p><p>Maybe that’s a more compelling way of looking at the movie. The incredible amount of guidance and oversight and care that goes into trying to help someone who is in a bad place. Maybe even a metaphor for depression. At some point, being asked questions by The Green Lady (I think it is very cool that The Lady is the same actress that plays his girlfriend back in Camelot), he answers something about wanting to be a knight and wanting something better, wanting to pursue knighthood. But it seems half-hearted! It feels like something he thinks he ought to say. [2] He’s faced nothing but starvation, danger, and robbery on his journey. He didn’t even want to go on this journey, he hoped it was all just a joke. Who would really want that? Life is hard!!! Drinking all day is easy. He wants all of the glory without doing any of the work. The end of the movie can be seen as a triump: he casts away the comfort of complacency and accepts that change and growth are difficult.</p><p>So we end with a man who is not a knight, not even particularly knightly, but who appears to have embraced the fact that things could not go on as they were. He is on a journey to knighthood. He is taking his first step. This is recovery.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg" width="390" height="597.1875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:784,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:390,&quot;bytes&quot;:141863,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F895c74ad-56de-427e-9d29-d778a51fec1b_512x784.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">If your Sir Gawain doesn’t look like this that’s not a Sir Gawain, that’s a frogge</figcaption></figure></div><p><br></p><h3><strong>Stuart Rosenberg - Cool Hand Luke (1967)</strong></h3><p>Spoilers for: This movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Easy Rider</p><p>Before watching this I thought this was a movie about cowboys, and when I told my friends Max and Lauren that I watched this, they both revealed that they, also, thought this was a cowboy movie. If you, dear reader, also happen to think this is a cowboy movie: it’s not. It’s a prison movie. I think some combination of “Cool Hand Luke” sounding like a cowboy name and Paul Newman also being in Butch Cassidy makes this movie also seem like it would be a cowboy movie.</p><p>So: Cool Hand Luke is a prison movie, made in 1967. It’s anti-establishment! The rebel who fights against the system to the last. It reminded me a lot of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (The novel, because I have not seen the movie: 1962) and Easy Rider (The movie, 1969). Constant rebellion, and success! The begrudging respect of your tough guy peers. Fighting the system, before, ultimately, death.</p><p>It’s hard for me to have anything more to say about this movie. I wish I understood the Christ imagery more. I wish I understood why he suddenly wants to escape prison after his mother’s death after being just fine in there before. In his soliloquy at the end, he attempts to talk to God and ask why God gave him this insatiable rebellious streak. But it didn’t seem like that much of a problem until his mom died! He was perfectly content just eating way too many eggs as his act of rebellion. That’s the central conflict of the movie and it’s entirely un-analyzed. Maybe that’s my job, but to be honest I’m starting to get kind of tired, so I’ll leave that there.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg" width="430" height="528.3276450511945" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:586,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:430,&quot;bytes&quot;:111463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff239e3e8-3e40-4e61-8532-d7c76139ce83_586x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Hey baby it’s me Paul Newman the incredibly handsome and talented actor</figcaption></figure></div><p>Otherwise, I think this movie (and this kind of movie!) was probably a lot more relevant at the time than today. This was filmed and released right as opposition to the Vietnam War was mounting. Think about Luke as the public, opposing a war, and being forced into it regardless by the government. Of course it resonated. Of course people were looking for rebellious folk heroes. And of course it doesn’t land the same way today, decades later, after hundreds of other movies have taken their cue from this one. Yeah, Luke is really cool. He eats a lot of eggs. But I can’t help but feel like I’ve already seen this.<br><br></p><h2>Music</h2><p>———————</p><h3><strong>* Electric Light Orchestra - Discovery</strong></h3><p>This is a nostalgic album for me that my dad would play all the time, and I think ELO are, undeniably, a very fun band to listen to.</p><h3><strong>Cold Room Heady - Water Under The Dehydrated Bridge</strong></h3><p>I’m impressed by the musical output of this artist but wish they did something a little tighter.</p><h3><strong>* Lucius - EP</strong></h3><p>This band is the band that does that “Aaa-aa-ah HA” song that was in a bunch of advertisements. Really solid indie pop. This band also the band with the iconic “Wildewoman” album cover which seems like it was all over the place? Or ingrained itself in my mind somehow. I don’t know.</p><h3><strong>* Testament - The Legacy</strong></h3><p>This was a thrash band I got very into in high school, I listened to them a lot more than metallica and actually burned a CD of this album. I still think they hold up, great riffs, great songs, I just wish the audio quality for this was better (on Spotify at least). It does not sound very good.</p><p>———————</p><p>[1] My biggest problem with this movie is it doesn’t really have anything to do with the source material. It just uses it to establish a cool setting and characters. It’d be like making a movie called “Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone”  but Harry never becomes a wizard and it’s about something else. Sure, maybe that’s a good movie. But why does it have to be Harry Potter? Why is it called Harry Potter? Do your own thing.</p><p>And with that kind of perspective, if The Green Knight were just a Hero’s Journey type movie, I would not think it was very good. A lot of stylistic ado about honestly, kind of a nothingburger of a story we’ve heard 10000 times. A reluctant hero takes up the sword. Neat. Who cares. But I think after writing what I did above I’ve come around on it. Looking at it as a movie about complacency and the difficulty of overcoming comfort, it’s very good. Even though it still has nothing to do with the source material.</p><p>[2] Green Knight Spoilers ahead: He’s also a narcissist but I’m not gonna get into that. He doesn’t like getting credit for cutting off the Green Knight’s head, he flees when The Green Lady tells him he’s not a knight. He doesn’t like the idea of people <em>knowing</em> what he himself believes: that he is a fraud. Repeating myself here but he wants all of the glory without any of the work, and part of that is that he thinks he deserves something better. There’s some subliminal narcissistic self-aggrandizement going on there. Maybe he’s incapable of telling his girlfriend that he cares about her because secretly he thinks he can do better. That’s why he abandons her in the fantasy “what if” sequence at the end. That’s what he’s imagining, whether he knows it or not, when he can’t answer her.</p><p>———————</p><p>That’s it for the past two weeks! Have a great day.</p>
