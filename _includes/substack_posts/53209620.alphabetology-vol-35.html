None of the four left any writing of their own, and we only know their thought through secondhand documents. This leaves a lot of room for interpretation as to who the figures actually were and what they were really like, as their portrayal in these secondhand documents changes over time. This is an immense problem to tackle, and in my view, honestly, not the most interesting, given that what is being disputed is who the people were rather than what their teachings and impact on the world have been.</p><p>I also think the section on Jesus is kind of weird because he doesn’t get into Christianity at all — he just talks about Jesus as a person and what we can mostly agree on Jesus having done. I can’t say I totally agree with discussing Jesus as a figure and his lasting impact without having anything to say about Christianity, but it is what it is.</p><p>This is a good introduction to four individuals whose schools of thought (ways of life, really) radically influenced how society developed. It is a refreshing mix of western and eastern philosophy. It’s short and to the point(ish). If this is the kind of thing you’re into, and you don’t already know a bunch about these people, it’s worth checking out.</p><h2>Movies</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Roman Holiday*</strong></h3><p>A charming little movie. It is beautiful, with plenty of shots of Rome, the actors all look like they’re having fun, and its a fun watch with a cartoonish sense of humor. I thought it was a little long at first but the movie really grew on me the more I thought about it after watching it.</p><p>Princess Anne (played by Audrey Hepburn) is at the point of suffering a mental breakdown from the stress of her royal duties, going from place to place with a calendar packed full of canned speeches to deliver, emissaries and delegates to meet, and an early bedtime. She sneaks out, influenced by a medical injection intended to treat her hysteria, and after being given a place to spend the night by a gentlemanly Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) she decides to take the next day off and enjoy herself in Rome rather than return to her royal duties. Bradley, a news reporter, pretends to not know she is the Princess in order to write the exclusive story about the Princess’s REAL self.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg" width="640" height="463" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:463,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:109074,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05de6ceb-b644-4b01-8c77-8c8f74903510_640x463.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What follows are multiple scenes of the Princess having a blast: she gets a fashionable haircut, buys sandals, and eats ice cream. The constant tension of whether Bradley’s veil of lies will fall apart is broken by scenes of Bradley bonking his co-conspirator, Irving (played by Eddie Albert) on the head like a Looney Tune. We ride this tension out to the end of Princess Anne’s big day out, and see how it resolves the next morning, which I think is where the movie really came together for me.</p><p>It’s a great movie that trusts the audience. We see how they meet, we understand how and why their relationship develops, and we aren’t put through awkward miscommunications and bizarre quasi-romantic hoops. Bradley and Anne share a wonderful experience, and it is powerful enough to speak for itself.</p><h2>Recipes</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>Spring Tofu Soup* - Alison Roman, New York Times</strong></h3><p>[<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021030-spring-tofu-soup">link</a>]</p><p>This is a delicious soup. The jalapeño/lemon/garlic paste is the real star of this recipe and something I want to eat by the spoonful. The asparagus is delicious, the mushrooms are delicious, the soy sauce (I used low sodium) is perfect, the broth is delicious, I love this soup. It’s light and flavorful. The only thing I didn’t do that the recipe suggest is drizzle olive oil on top. I’ve made this twice and it came out great both times. Really easy to make too, although it does take a few minutes to grate down the jalapeño and garlic and then zest the lemons.</p><p>This recipe is also great because you can just use whatever leftovers you have in the fridge before they start going bad. As written it calls for 4 scallions for garnish, which is already great - I’ve never been able to use an entire package of scallions before they start going bad.</p><p>Taking that to an extreme though, check this out:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png" width="1278" height="398" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:398,&quot;width&quot;:1278,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:115860,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a915774-361e-469f-9020-29c23a177c48_1278x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These substitutions… this is just an entirely different soup! I understand that the recipe is meant to be just a “whatever’s in the pantry” recipe but this person substituted literally every part of the recipe!!!!!!!!!! </p><h2>Music</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><p>I’m trying a new thing, and not writing about things I don’t have much to say about.</p><h3><strong>Superchunk - Foolish</strong></h3><p>This band regularly goes through a revival in the indie music zeitgeist and I can’t say I totally get it. They do have a really unique, consistent sound that lives on a very thin line between dissonant, agressive post-hardcore, and a more radio friendly grunge/alt rock sound, which not many other bands manage to do. But that’s not a sound I really love.</p><h3><strong>Momma - Two of Me</strong></h3><p>I listened to this because it looked like there were some articles going around about how this band is the hot new thing. The musical ideas seem kind of underdeveloped and didn’t totally hit for me, and it moved around a lot so, for example, I didn’t get the things that I liked about the song Biohazard in other songs, but I also didn’t get anything to replace what I liked about Biohazard. Just something kind of similar. Alas.<br>Update: I have read an article about this and it’s a concept album. So the idea(s) they really dug into and explored are there, in the lyrics. I don’t really pay attention to lyrics a lot of the time, so this didn’t land for me. This is obviously way overexaggerated but I feel like liking this for the concept would be like liking Cocteau Twins songs for their lyrics. Take that as you will.</p><h3><strong>Cheap Haircuts - My American Dream</strong></h3><p>I was shocked when the vocals on the first tracked kicked in and sounded like a spot-on Tom Delong doing Jeff Mangum, before losing that charm and just sounding a lot like Aeroplane Over the Sea.</p><h3><strong>Retirement Party - Strictly Speaking*</strong></h3><p>That’s right, it’s my favorite genre: sad noodly indie pop love songs with muted femme vocals (see: Forth Wanderers, Yucky Duster, The Beths, Remember Sports)</p><h3><strong>Arcade Fire - Unconditional I*</strong></h3><p>Arcade Fire are still immediately identifiable as Arcade fire 18 years down the line, which is kind of impressive in its own way, when you think about all the bands that fans abandon because they change too much (see: Weezer). Anyway, this is pretty good, if you like the Arcade Fire sound.</p><div><hr></div><p>Thanks for reading, have a great day.</p>
