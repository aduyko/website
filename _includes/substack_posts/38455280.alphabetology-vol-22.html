Look at that!!!! It would be a beautiful piece without the ladder. But with??? Chef’s kiss.<br></p><h2>Books</h2><p>———————</p><h3><strong>Albert Camus - Exile and the Kingdom</strong></h3><p>I actually finished reading this last week but couldn’t figure out what to say that wasn’t already written in the introduction to this book. Camus explores national identity and personal identity, an idea of a home and belonging. He was born and raised in Algeria when it was a part of France, later in his life moving to and living in Paris. This book, a collection of short stories, was published in 1957, in the middle of the Algerian war for independence. These stories rose out of his attempt at understanding his feelings for his homeland, Algeria, and for his adopted homeland, France, which he loved, but where Algerians were othered. He constantly found himself not belonging. Camus died in a car accident before the war ended and did not see Algeria win its independence. </p><p>I won’t have a lot to say about all the stories but this was a good read. The only trouble is that Camus is kind of difficult because what he’s trying to write about is very explicit, and he doesn’t do anything tricky. But there’s a lot of room for you to do a lot of work to figure out what the deeper implications of that are. Here are the stories:</p><h4><strong>The Adulterous Woman</strong></h4><p>This is such a cool way to start the collection of stories — a woman on vacation in a foreign land with her husband is filled with a sense of romantic wonder for this new land, dreams of possibilities, resigns herself to the impossibility of her dreams, and cries. She is a stranger, attracted to the land on a surface level, and assumes that it will reject her pre-emptively, not having done anything to try to connect to it. This is our starting point: imagining the infinite possibilities, what could have been, what might still be, if but were we someone else, somewhere else.</p><h4><strong>The Renegade</strong></h4><p>I didn’t like this story very much because it has to do with a man being mentally broken down and involves a lot of violence, very unpleasant stuff. But for the sake of this story, let’s suspend any disbelief and march forth.</p><p>The narrator here never really learns the culture of the tribe. He never learns their language. His tongue is cut out for a transgression, and he lacks any ability to communicate with them. He develops and becomes obsessed with his own ideas about how their religion functions, adopts it as his own (maybe adopts it is unfair to say. He is a Catholic missionary and is tortured and abused until his mind breaks down, and he adopts their religion in his own thoughts, possibly in a state of insanity). But what he believes about them is not grounded in reality.</p><p>We again feel the central conflict of these stories: wanting to belong, thinking you belong, but not truly belonging. Missing either honesty or conviction in your behavior, and paying a price. Our missionary certainly has conviction, but he places that conviction in something he made up in his head, and he behaves almost entirely out of self-interest throughout. He hops around between beliefs in search of salvation.</p><h4><strong>The Silent Men</strong></h4><p>This story is cool although slightly out of the way of the theme of belonging in a country — here we look at belonging in a class solidarity way. Camus was a member of the French Communist Party before he rejected them as being too radical (and lost his good friend Sartre in the process!), but he had lifelong sympathy for the plight of the working class.</p><p>So it’s kind of clever to see that being used to look at how this idea of “belonging” is empowering, allowing the workers to stage their anger and disappointment following the failure of their strike, but also allows them to more easily squash down their humanity and keep up their protest (a silent protest! They refused to speak to him) in the face of the owner’s young daughter being rushed off to the hospital with an illness. Not a single thought or prayer for the daughter of a man they had known and had a good relationship with for decades.</p><p>I think this is my favorite story in this collection.</p><h4><strong>The Guest</strong></h4><p>Maybe a well known fun fact about this story, but in French the title is L'Hôte, which can be translated as both “guest” or “host”.</p><p>We read this story in my high school existentialism class and analyzed it and I don’t remember what came out of that discussion very well. Daru is our protagonist, given the task of taking an arab man to police headquarters in a nearby town. He tells the man who delivered the prisoner to him that he will not do it, rejecting the rule of law, but then simply lets the prisoner go free at a crossroads, letting the prisoner choose whether to turn himself in or flee to safety. The prisoner chooses to turn himself in, and his family leaves a threatening message for Daru because he “turned their brother in.” A true comedy of errors.</p><p>Daru is reaching for some greater moral truth here, letting people make their own choices, but I don’t know about that. If he is strongly against turning the prisoner in, why does he let the prisoner do it himself? In recent times, being apolitical or refusing to be involved is frowned upon big time — you have catchy slogans like “silence is violence” and so on. Not to get too stuck in the weeds here, but I think there’s some truth in that. Especially when you’re taking explicit political action the way Daru is. You can’t take half measures and hope to absolve yourself of responsibility. And thus, he gets his just deserts.</p><p>On a thematic front, he has distanced himself from both French authority by rejecting its rule over the customs of the prisoner, and he has found himself rejected by the family of the arab man he tried to offer freedom to. That’s just how it is sometimes.</p><h4><strong>The Artist At Work</strong></h4><p>I didn’t really like this story at all. It mimics Kafka but without Kafka’s charm (Yeah that’s right I said it. Kafka has a very charming way of writing. And he’s funny too. Sue me).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg" width="342" height="528.5454545454545" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1360,&quot;width&quot;:880,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:342,&quot;bytes&quot;:302856,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff564de2f-031b-4ec0-aaa6-142283c2f86c_880x1360.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This charming fellow</figcaption></figure></div><p>But to do a lazy tie-in here, this story is about being told you belong when you would be better off elsewhere. Not pursuing your own beliefs. Etc.</p><h4><strong>The Growing Stone</strong></h4><p>Imagine if Meursault from The Stranger tried to do something good with his life instead of shooting an innocent man on a beach because the sun was too hot. I think this is the only story where the protagonist is finally accepted into a community, and a fitting ending to the collection of stories.</p><p>Unlike the other stories, our protagonist, d’Arrast, is not a cultural voyeur, and is not resigned to his lot in life. He has agency and wields it with intention. He is an engineer and arrives in a town in Brazil to look at a bridge. The town officials are unpleasant — boring, too obsessed with ceremony and law. The locals don’t like him much either. He takes upon himself the task of carrying a large stone (also in the blinding heat of the sun. The sun is Camus’ favorite antagonist) to church in place of a local man, but instead throws it into a fire pit in the center of the man’s house. He not only internally but externally and publicly rejects the colonizers by turning away from the church and towards the site of a traditional dance the locals had the night prior. He picks a side and takes a course of action which he believes will ring true with the people. They accept him for it.<br><br></p><h2>Movies</h2><p>———————</p><h3><strong>Lee Chang-dong - Burning (2018)</strong></h3><p>I will have more thoughts about this movie (on its own, without comparing it to the short story it is based on) next week! I did not give myself enough time to write this week’s newsletter.</p><p>This is based on the Murakami short story “Barn Burning” (which I have learned is, in turn, based on another story? Could not find anything online to verify this. But that would be a neat little telephone chain of story re-telling, almost like an oral tradition with all of its personalized alterations as it goes from author to author) (Actually I looked this up and there’s a Faulkner short story called “Barn Burning” which is a very cool reference made in the movie too. But it has nothing to do with the Murakami story), but tells a very different story. It is very difficult for me to think about this movie without discussing the story as well, however. The venn diagram of the plots of the movie and the story looks like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png" width="490" height="412.4166666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:95698,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb760eaa8-6f0c-4746-ba37-4092dffe0cae_960x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A lot is added, and I don’t think the additions would work within the original. Of course, Murakami seems like he would be hard to adapt to film without any additions. His works are airy and eerie, a lot is left unstated, a lot is left unconcluded, many long silences and vague mental images and feelings are assumed. But anyway, the story is a very short read, and you can do both, and experience how an almost identical set of facts can be used to create two completely different experiences. That is what is so interesting about this movie to me.</p><p>Spoilers ahead, so watch out.</p><p>The movie makes a few critical changes to the relationships between the three main characters and turns everything in the story on its head. I couldn’t tell you what the original story is about, definitively. Naively I want to say it’s about the people in your life that come and go and how they can spark interests in your life. The movie, on the other hand, is about self-determination! About what you can make of yourself, about the forces of society that pressure you! FREEDOM! Which I will write about more next week. But to get into the meat of just how different the two are:</p><ul><li><p>In the movie, the things that are burned are greenhouses instead of barns. They look like this, which makes a lot more sense to me than how I visualize a barn:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png" width="500" height="207" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:207,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:171329,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6df17cb6-f9fe-4f54-b77a-c38fa593d77e_500x207.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">thanks tumblur user ouugg for this screencap</figcaption></figure></div></li><li><p>The narrator is characterized very differently in the original story. In the story, he is in his thirties, maybe? And is married. He is an established writer, rather than one who is just starting out and can’t figure out what to write about.</p></li><li><p>He is not in a physical relationship or in love with the Hae-Mi character! They’re just friends. It is much less jarring when she suddenly disappears because she’s not literally his only friend. They just hang out every once in a while. Sex is not really part of the story. It’s much less sinister and there’s much less tension around the entire story because he explicitly doesn’t think about her.</p></li><li><p>The Ben character is much less creepy/distant! Him and the protagonist are just on different wavelengths. They have trouble keeping a conversation going.</p></li><li><p>The crux of the matter! The central conflict! In the story, the Ben character is the one who brings it up with the protagonist. The protagonist is too busy thinking about barns and time passes until he runs into Ben by chance. Ben then asks him when the last time he saw Hae-Mi was, and that he’s tried to call and that she hasn’t been at her apartment or mime class. It feels much less sinister overall, it’s just a classic Murakami disappearing person thing. This seems impossible to translate to a standalone movie.</p></li><li><p>There’s no cat? Jong-su (the protagonist) doesn’t stalk him and there are no sinister clues or signs implying that Ben had anything to do with Hae-Mi’s disappearance. Him being painted in this manner is purely for the movie.</p></li></ul><p>So, with all of these changes, Ben becomes a villain, symbolic of (I’ll get into this next week), and Jong-su… well. He sucks, by the way. There’s almost nothing redeeming about him. Unlike the story, where it doesn’t really matter if he’s redeemable or not, he’s just a guy, and nothing really happens. A friend of his vanishes and he has awkward conversations with this guy she was dating. The guy says he burns down barns but it doesn’t seem like any get burnt. That’s the story. I thought the movie would try to capture this aetherial inconclusiveness but it doesn’t. Alas. So it’s better thought about independently of the story, which I will try to do next week.<br><br></p><h2>Music</h2><p>———————</p><h3><strong>* The Academy Is… - Almost Here (Emo)</strong></h3><p>I hesitated to give this a star because it feels kind of embarassing but I thought this was a lot of fun and I am going to be honest about that. This is very 2000’s pop-punky emo in the vein of Fallout Boy or P!ATD and they do a great job. “Black Mamba” and “The Phrase That Pays” are such fun songs.</p><h3><strong>Finch - What It Is to Burn (Alt Rock)</strong></h3><p>I didn’t like this at all sorry, very post-grungy alt-rocky.</p><h3><strong>* Nuvolascura - As We Suffer From Memory &amp; Imagination (Emotive Hardcore)</strong></h3><p>Yes….. YES!!!!!! Fully sick. Love it. This band and Burial Etiquette are two contemporary screamo/post-hardcore bands with screaming female vocals and really cool 80’s post- feeling grooves and lots of dynamic range in the music and they are EXCElelnt. Unbelievably good. Nuvolascura are a little more technical/proggy but still very much post-hardcore and still fully sick.</p><h3><strong>DaBaby - BLAME IT ON BABY (Hip-hop)</strong></h3><p>Let’s goooo. This was alright. I didn’t realize DaBaby was a big deal outside of the memes online!!! But I think the stuff on Youtube with the clarinets or whatever is really fun, and I like when he leans into the weirder sounds like on “BLAME IT ON BABY.”</p><h3><strong>Ghost - Meliora (Rock/Doom/Prog)</strong></h3><p>Spooky, epic (in a theatric way) arena rock!!!!!! Not for me, however. Also, I listened to this first and then realized this is the band with all the theatrics around dressing up like the scary pope when performing.</p><h3><strong>Judas Priest - British Steel (Hard Rock)</strong></h3><p>Judas Priest never stuck when I was first getting into hard rock/heavy metal in high school the way other bands did, so it was nice to revisit this and realize that they’re very cool. Except that a few songs on this just seem really out of place? Compare the fully sick leading track “Rapid Fire” or “The Rage” or “Steeler,” any of the relatively heavier songs, to “Living After Midnight” or like, “United” (which is one of the worst songs in the world. I hate this song so much????? It’s unreal). What is going on with those two songs.</p><p>Also, I think the album art for this album is a) (unironic) Very cool, looks great b) Really funny? Badass guy holding the world’s largest razor blade.</p><h3><strong>UFO - Phenomenon (Hard Rock)</strong></h3><p>This however did not stick at all!!! It’s cool but I couldn’t shake the thought “this is the definition of dad rock” while listening to it and I don’t have any nostalgia associated with UFO the way I do with other similar bands like, say, Deep Purple or Rainbow.</p><p>———————</p><p>That’s it for this week, thanks for reading, have a great day.</p>
