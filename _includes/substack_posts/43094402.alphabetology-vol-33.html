There’s an anecdote in some episode of the podcast “The Relentless Picnic” where a poet making a guest appearance mentions that he didn’t understand poetry that he read until experiencing a deeply painful loss. Then he returned to some poem that he read and didn’t understand as a kid and thought “Oh. That’s what this is about.” And I expect that that is the only way for me to appreciate this movie. It’s beautiful, it feels real and natural in a way almost no other movie does. This movie is realer than reality.</p><p>[1]</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>[1] I think for a dream-like movie this one is really way too heavy-handed for me. We keep hearing “grace” or whatever and his mom’s an angel all the time. Everything that happens gets a matching bit of narration to make it really clear to you what the character is experiencing in case you somehow can’t put two and two together. The narration is all super simplistic and really repetitive. You get no credit as a viewer. But it kind of makes sense why it clobbers you over the head with straightforward, repetitive thoughts; being a man’s plunge into his childhood memories. I don’t tend to be particularly metaphorical when I’m thinking about my past. So it’s not very artful (kind of ironically, given that this film is an art film), but it furthers the craft of what this movie’s going for. Kind of cool. Like I think I would have liked this movie a lot more if it really pushed the abstract nature of memory and didn’t lay things out so clearly, but I think that would turn it into a very different movie, and it wouldn’t be nearly as effective at doing its thing. It would feel more like a movie and less like a real trip through childhood memories.</p><div><hr></div><p>That’s all for this week, have a great day.</p>
