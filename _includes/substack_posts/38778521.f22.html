<h3><strong>You Can Just Believe Whatever You Want, Probably (Part 1)</strong></h3><p>People love to rag on The Secret (2006), a book I have never read, but if I understand its core message, it’s that if you believe in things really hard, they’ll happen. And you know what? That’s probably truer than not. And you believe this! I think placebo and nocebo affects are pretty well studied and commonly accepted. And all they are is you just thinking your way into feeling better/worse. You believe that you will, and, to some capacity, it happens. And we have STUDIED this.</p><p>Actually, going even further, there’s [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6402571/">this</a>] insane study [1] which suggests that there are medicines you can take that increase the effectiveness of <em>the placebo effect. </em>But this kind of tracks — if you can make your brain a little more open to suggestion and a little more open to the idea that something will happen, whatever mechanisms the regular placebo effect works through would also be amplified.</p>
