<p>I’m falling behind on these! And I’ve given up on giving “deep thought” to Atonement or The Master. It hasn’t happened.</p><blockquote><p>HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A WIKI USER WHO CANNOT GIVE ME AN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE AND JUST GOES ON NON LOGIC.....The user Ragib.......Notice he said that I have a "long history of starting frivolous "X started in India" debates.....And yet he won't tell me how im wrong. Hey Ragib, instead of mis leading people about me having Frivolous debates, how bout telling people how im wrong?........He can't do that cus he will lose the argument.........and by the way.......Ragib......Are you sure it's frivolous? Are you sure you want to say that? Are you sure about homie? Becuase according to this aritcle CHESS STARTED IN INDIA. That is not something I started. That was ALREADY on the article. So does that mean the people who put that in the article (THAT CHESS ORIGINATED IN INDIA) are also starting "Frivolous" debates?......Ooooooo what do you say now Ragib? That's right I win and you lose the argument.</p></blockquote><p>- ARYAN818, Wikipedia talk page for [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chess/Archive_5#Question_here">Chess</a>]</p><div><hr></div><h3>Books</h3><p>* Atonement</p><h3>Movies</h3><p>* The Master</p><p>* The Beach Bum</p><h3>Music</h3><p>* Deep Purple</p><p>* Miles Davis</p><p>* Barlow</p><p>Polyphia</p><p>Portal</p><p>Gravity</p><p>* Godspeed You!

I spoiled it for myself by skipping ahead and reading the ending because the first section was starting to stress me out, so I skipped ahead to the second section, but I didn’t understand what was going on, so I skipped ahead some more and spoiled everything before going back and reading it through properly. And I still thought it was really good!</p><p>There are some complaints about the book on Goodreads, which I read and thought kind of missed the point. I think it’s kind of easy to take any of the events of the novel and discuss whether they make sense and who is responsible for what when it’s really not about any of the specifics, it’s not about anyone or anything but Briony and her inability to see or process anything outside of herself.</p><p>Very explicitly! She is an author wielding her power to fantasize about what could have been. She avoids reality, she avoids confrontation, she can’t take a step back and imagine anything in the world moving without her. That’s why the “crime” she is so obsessed with that needs atonement is not the actual  horrific crime that occurs. That is why the victims are not the actual victims of the crime, but the victims of Briony’s actions. She lives a life of delusion from start to finish, a life of fear, a life afraid of the truth. And there is no atonement. There can be no atonement. There is only self-obsessed fiction — the “but what if.”</p><h2>Movies</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>The Master (2012)</strong></h3><p>I wish Freddie (played by Joaquin Phoenix) didn’t stop making moonshine out of industrial cleaners halfway through the movie.</p><p>My favorite thing about this movie was that the cult resolved Freddie’s issues! The master’s methodologies worked. Which ones worked, or how they worked, or why they worked, is unclear to everyone involved. The cult thing is clearly just fraud and brainwashing, but being involved with the Master helps Freddie confront his past trauma. He is able to move on with his life. Meanwhile, the Master himself somehow falls into the trappings of his own power and is shackled to his post. Pretty good movie. Very pretty too, and great acting. Wow!</p><h3><strong>The Beach Bum (2019)</strong></h3><p>I don’t know if this is because I’ve read a lot about Korine’s other work like Gummo or Spring Breakers, but this movie is basically about the american dream, right? All of his work is very distinctly American in a way I don’t think any other director captures — it’s not about being a specific American. It’s about the country. It’s about what the country dreams of. There’s wish fulfilment, and then there’s hedonistic individualism propelled to success and fortune through sheer force of hedonistic individualism. What’s more American than that? Halfway through the movie you start wondering if what you’re witnessing is a dream, and it is. It’s the American Dream. That’s right baby.</p><p>Anyway, I thought this movie was great. A truly delectable treat.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Music</h2><p>— — — — — —</p><h3><strong>* Deep Purple - Machine Head (Hard Rock)</strong></h3><p>Hard rock is an incredible name for a genre. Anyway, this is a classic album, I grew up listening to it, the really long Deep Purple songs are the unsung gems - Lazy is an unbelievable song. One of my favorite songs in the world. Highway Star is somehow six minutes long and holds strong the entire time. Maybe I’m a Leo is sick. Pictures of Home is sick. Never Before isn’t as good as the rest of the album but is still pretty good. Smoke on the Water is pretty good. Lazy is, as stated above, incredible. Space Truckin’ is a really fun song to end the album on. This album rocks.</p><h3><strong>* Miles Davis - Kind of Blue (Jazz)</strong></h3><p>That’s right baby it’s jazz, and it’s a classic for a reason. Star power on every instrument, incredible.</p><h3><strong>* Barlow - Walls of Future (Shoegaze, Dream Pop)</strong></h3><p>I like this band a lot, I don’t love shoegaze but Barlow do it for me, and amidst all the effects-up’d hazy grooves they slam you with stuff like “Ankh”. Very cool.</p><h3><strong>Polyphia - New Levels New Devils (Prog Rock, Experimental)</strong></h3><p>A coworker suggested this calling it a jazzier Animals as Leaders and I think that sounds about right. It’s cool! A little easier to listen to than AaL, but also less djenty, so you win some you lose some.</p><h3><strong>Portal - Outre (Doom Metal)</strong></h3><p>This is just evil music for evil people! A little bit like Sunn 0))), hard for me to really comment on it more than this.</p><h3><strong>Gravity - Saturnalia Temple (Stoner Metal)</strong></h3><p>This didn’t totally land for me, I don’t think I love any of the singers, but their guitar tones are spot on.</p><h3><strong>* Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven (Post-Rock)</strong></h3><p>Mama mia, I was busy listening to Explosions in the Sky in high school when instead I should’ve been listening to these guys. Transcendant.</p><p>— — — — — —</p><p>I’m listening to the hit song Serve the Servants and making this face</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif" width="276" height="271.4754098360656" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:240,&quot;width&quot;:244,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:276,&quot;bytes&quot;:279713,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48cba74a-1380-4c40-97b1-422fa2be158e_244x240.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div>
