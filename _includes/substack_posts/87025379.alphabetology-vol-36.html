<h3>Movies</h3><p>Everything Everywhere All at Once*<br>Jaws<br>Licorice Pizza*<br>Uncut Gems*<br>The French Connection<br>Call Me by Your Name*<br>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre<br>Gladiator<br>Gone with The Wind*</p><h3><strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once*</strong></h3><p>A touching story about family that unfolds out of an action thriller - burdens, expectations, acceptance, generational and socialeconomic pressures, the desire to be someone else.</p><p>The way that horror or sci-fi use genre to address fundamentally human issues, this movie does with action. It transcends genre and tropes, is a really unique experience that I’m glad the directors took so many risks with.</p><h3><strong>Jaws</strong></h3><p>It’s Jaws. Lots of fun, I think the animatronic shark looks great when you actually get to see it, I love Robert Shaw in this as a crazed old hand at shark-hunting. John Williams kills it with the soundtrack, as he does.</p><h3><strong>Licorice Pizza*</strong></h3><p>I think this is the most approachable PTA movie, and simultaneously a greatest hits reel for him. Distilled PTA. Two people who are absolutely terrible for and to each other but who can’t escape each other, stuck and surrounded by a time and place bringing out the worst in people (1973 LA). One of my favorite movies I watched this year.</p><h3><strong>Uncut Gems*</strong></h3><p>Very stressful movie, as everyone says. I read elsewhere that if you stop and think for a minute, Sandler’s character, Howard Ratner, doesn’t really have any of these problems that drive him and the viewer crazy all movie. He has tons of money. He has a home that his neighbors are jealous of AND a gigantic loft apartment.</p><p>The end of the movie kind of shows this: he owns a fancy jewelry store! It’s visited by celebrities! He has relatives with plenty of money, who let him borrow it!!! during the movie! I can’t imagine how money is possibly a problem for him. But he turns it into a problem, with an insatiable need to keep stress and adrenaline piled on himself. And he drags everyone else, including the audience, into his world of shit.</p><h3><strong>The French Connection</strong></h3><p>I really like that this movie doesn’t have a soundtrack. It makes everything feel more bleak and desperate. Otherwise, it’s fine - it’s a kind of slow crime thriller.</p><h3><strong>Call Me by Your Name*</strong></h3><p>Very good! Coming of age story, learning about love and learning that some things don’t last.</p><p>This movie was nothing like what I expected it to be, in ways that I liked. I like that every supporting character in the story is fully supportive of Chalamet’s character, Ello, because it really emphasizes that this is NOT a movie made to tell a story, it’s a movie about an experience one boy has, and how it affects him. His father’s speech at the end drives this home: he’s speaking to Ello but he’s telling the audience how to understand and process this movie.</p><p>It’s also kind of subtle, I think, but you’re also seeing the movie from Ello’s perspective. You get hints of Oliver (Hammer’s character) and his own anxieties, but they’re an afterthought. Ello still needs to grow up (figuratively), and doesn’t have that kind of empathy, his own ego and anxieties consume his world. And at the end he has to confront this reality.</p><p>I also really like that it basically ends twice! It ends again after ending the first time just to really drive it home that this little story in Ello’s life has truly come to a close, and there isn’t going to be any continuation in the future.</p><p>Great movie.</p><h3><strong>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</strong></h3><p>I didn’t realize that Humphrey Bogart played a lot of villains in his career, with my mental image of him constructed from his roles in <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. I think the ending is kind of funny in a moralistic kind of way, where the comeuppance you expect is subverted but good things happen to the good guys and bad things happen to the bad guys anyway. Walter Huston is incredible in this.</p><p>It’s a movie where the natural environment and fortune reveal the true nature of people. I can’t say I thought this movie was one of the best ever, but it’s possible that it’s had such an outsizes influence on movies to come that I’ve already seen its echoes enough to find it tired.</p><h3><strong>Gladiator</strong></h3><p>Russell Crowe is so bad in this!!! I don’t think he’s a good dramatic actor.</p><p>It’s a fun movie, the soundtrack is great, but it’s also a very straightforward Hollywood movie. The good guys are unquestionably good, and cool, and talented, and the bad guys are just rotten to the core from the start. Can’t complain.</p><h3><strong>Gone With the Wind*</strong></h3><p>I laughed out loud a few times at how ridiculous a lot of the intertitle cards are with regard to the civil war - that devilish Sherman, come to destroy the honorable south. The movie (and book it’s based on? Which is still considered one of the best of all time? I didn’t know that) really obviously tries to whitewash a lot of the horror of slavery and the causes of the Civil War. But if you acknowledge that a lot of it is southern propagandizing and keep that in mind while watching, it’s an incredible movie about obsession, trauma, overcoming adversity, growing up, and the horror of war. As others say, an American <em>War and Peace</em>.</p>
