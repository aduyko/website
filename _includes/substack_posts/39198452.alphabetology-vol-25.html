<blockquote><p>I would say wow, I was shocked to read a Wikipedia article that so discredited what it purported to write about. The only reason there is no scientific evidence to back up reiki is because western science is so primitive and is looking for the wrong things. The action of ki (Chinese, qi) is related to quantum, and ki is everywhere; reiki simply channels it.&nbsp;<strong>If you felt how a reiki practitioner's hands heat up like a furnace</strong>, or how the body's qi blocks break up under this influence, you would have no doubt that reiki works. But if you don't understand the whole concept of qi and have no idea how to feel it within your own body, you will laugh at it because you have been taught to laugh at it. You are laughing out of ignorance. This is intolerable in an authorative venue like Wikipedia.</p></blockquote><p>- Wikipedia talk page for [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reiki/Archive_6">Reiki</a>]</p><p>Something about how this person decided to bold the sentence about hands heating up like a furnace really tickles me.

If you’ve read any of Potok’s other work reading this will feel like putting on a comfortable pair of socks. His novels that I’ve read (The Promise, My Name Is Asher Lev, The Gift of Asher Lev) have centered around conflicts between orthodox Jewish communities and members of these communities who, despite being devout in their beliefs, challenge the status quo in some way, and struggle trying to find peace between their personal beliefs and their community. Some never achieve this, some find redemption through other avenues. The Asher Lev books are about art.</p><p>I like that the entire conflict of this novel is a decision the protagonist at first doesn’t realize he has to make, and then at the end, is not allowed to make. There’s something very honest and true about the characters just going about their day to day lives while living under a constant spectre of unresolved problems in their lives. Asher’s family is thriving in Brooklyn and he is not. His parents want him to stay, but the rest of the religious community wants him to leave. What should he do? How do you even begin to approach a decision like this? He ponders it for 300 pages, makes a decision, and his decision is instantly overruled. But maybe everything is for the best, in the end. It is in the hands of the Master of the Universe.</p><p>As a sequel this book is kind of interesting because My Name Is Asher Lev focuses a lot on Asher as an artist, him learning and creating and coming into his own. This book begins with Asher in a slump. He draws a lot, sure. But art does not consume his life the way it does in the first book. This is much more a book about being an adult and having a family and figuring out the line between what’s best for you and what’s best for those around you. The role of art in this book feels kind of secondary.</p><p>I think Potok was a really talented writer and his work is all thoroughly engaging, he captures the internal conflicts of his characters with a light touch but still capturing their incredible gravity. His work is really good and worth reading, and paints a really unique portrait of what it’s like being a member of an Orthodox Jewish community in a modern world.</p><p>Also, an absolutely bonkers bit of trivia, Potok was also an artist, and <em>actually painted</em> the painting “Brooklyn Crucifixion” which is very important to both of the Asher Lev novels.

I can’t imagine that you’re supposed to think about this movie too much. I like to suspend my disbelief as much as the next person, but the ending of this movie did not strike me as inspirational or hopeful at all, and left me unsure of what to make of the movie as a whole.</p><p>Spoilers ahead because the ending really bothers me!!!! Everything leading up to the very end I am on board with. Train drama, bring it on. But they blow up the train, it seems like everyone is dead except for a teen and a child, and their sign of hope is a polar bear? What are they supposed to do with a polar bear? Is it a sign that other animals are alive, and the polar bear is eating them? I don’t know. Are there plants???? I don’t have any faith in these two children surviving and bringing humanity back just because they saw a polar bear<em>.</em> This is disbelief I cannot suspend.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png" width="1456" height="785" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:785,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1357957,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1817d36d-133b-4271-adab-c9aec4939191_1698x916.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Honestly, if this bear were drinking an ice cold coca cola.

Now we’re going to be inspired by a polar bear.” Which, I’m kind of on board with, insofar as I like to just throw things away as being insignificant in a bigger picture. Whoever has control of the train is meaningless if it is, once again, possible to sustain life outside of the train. But it seems like a weird angle to bring as the take-away shot of the movie. Purpose and duty and sacrifice are all issues that we explore and struggle over alongside Curtis, our protagonist, right up until the very end when Namgoong throws this getting off of the train wrench into things.</p><p>Really, look at it: Curtis makes it through the entire train. He sees all of his companions die, carries all of their hopes and desires. He is almost turned to ash in the face of how powerless he really is, before redeeming himself and sacrificing his arm to save a child. His arc ends. Then he immediately sacrifices his life!!!! For the two children to be able to live on in the outside world (hopefully). It’s almost like everything about leaving the train is an entirely different movie packed on top of a morality story.</p><p>That aside!!!!!!! Bong Joon-Ho just goes for it and the movie just oozes fun. Everyone making it seems to be having a blast. I have no idea how you could go through the big fight scene that opens with the fish and not think “this movie rules.” The fish!!!!!! </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif" width="400" height="225" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:225,&quot;width&quot;:400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4230160,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02b3c95-5c02-4e42-8aca-1dc5d4036e5c_400x225.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The polar bear should have done this to a fish in the final scene.

That aside, I’ve never listened to Cannibal Corpse, I’m kind of put off by the shock factor of a lot of their stuff, but it’s also death metal and impossible to understand what they’re singing. It’s good death metal!</p><h3><strong>Mohinder - O Nation, You Bleed From Many Wounds, 1896 (Post-Hardcore)</strong></h3><p>I don’t like listening to this but it does some really interesting stuff. Mohinder were there right at the very start of the post-hardcore/screamo wave coming out of the hardcore scene of the 80s, and this album has a really experimental feel and covers a surprising range of musical styles. This feels like the grind-core-y-est of all of the first wave of post-hardcore bands, with really roomy mixing, tempo changes, and abrasive sounds left and right. Not fun to listen to but really fun to see a band just trying to do something (that was at the time) new.</p><h3><strong>Toto - Toto IV (Rock, Jazz Fusion)</strong></h3><p>This is some of the most innocent radio rock you could ever listen to in your life. The 80’s are absolutely incomprehensible to me.</p><h3><strong>* Chisel - 8 A.M. All Day (Indie Rock)</strong></h3><p>I don’t know how this found its way onto my list of “every emo band” but that’s how I came across this band who, more than anything, make me think of indie rock in the vein of Pavement or Built to Spill. I like this album a lot. It feels very comfortable and confident and is a lot catchier than you’d guess.</p><h3><strong>Chisel - Nothing New (Indie Rock)</strong></h3><p>This is okay but not as good as 8 AM All Day, this album doesn’t feel as special. Not sure how to convey this impression of mine any better than that.</p><p>———————</p><p>That’s all for this week, have a great day.</p>
