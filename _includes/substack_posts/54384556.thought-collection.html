This is what i am all about, baby.</p><p>I “read” this in high school, but I believe that “reading” at that time meant skimming the text enough to be able to answer questions and forgetting it all promptly when moving on to the next assigned book. I don’t remember disliking Anna Karenina, just being very pressed for time. I’m glad I’m revisiting it now! It rules.</p><p>This is also the Garnett translation, and hers are often regarded as being very boring and soulless, but aside from some clunky word choice I think it’s fine. You open up with the famous quote about happy families and immediately go into Stepan Arkadeyovich Oblonsky rubbing his belly while going “Oooooh Aaah Oooooooh” as he remembers the scandal he has caused by cheating on his wife. I don’t think it’s possible to render the contents of this book in a dry way. I think it is a very funny book. And meaningful, too!</p><p>The praise that Tolstoy often gets for accurately representing the depths of the human soul is valid. Many of the characters aren’t exactly deep, but their one or two dimension of depth are often dimensions that are otherwise utterly ignored in any popular media. Anna’s husband, Alexey, </p>
