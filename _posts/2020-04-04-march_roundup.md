## Books

### Flow - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
It took me a couple of tries starting to read this and feeling frustrated and reading something else before I really sunk into it and started enjoying it. It definitely feels dated, both with cultural references and in writing style, but I think a lot of the substance holds up. I like the idea of having clear goals in your activities - it's something I've tried to do with figure drawing, and I think a lack of clear intention is a big part of why I have historically found it hard to stick to new activities. After the intitial hump of figuring out how to do something, I think it's really important to understand what you're trying to accomplish when you do something! I think framing it as a way of growing and becoming more complex as a person is also really appealing, and not something I can remember seeing in other psych/self-help type books. That being said, it seems like Csikszentmihalyi makes a lot of unsourced assumptions about human behavior, and it kind of feels like reading Foucalt. Sure, there's justification for some things, but I don't feel like the justification seems very trustworthy. If you don't agree with his premises, I don't think this book will really convince you otherwise. It also sets up a somewhat high-pressure expectation that you should never feel tired or need to decompress during your waking if you want to be the best version of yourself, which seems unhealthy. Despite its flaws, there's a lot in Flow that I agree with and that I can fit into my own mental model of how things work, and I'm thankful that I read it.

### Trick - Domenico Starnone t. Jhumpa Lahiri
The first page of this novel seemed very clumsy to me but I was quickly sucked in and found myself really enjoying the first half of the story. I like how it bounces between the family scenes, where the narrator is playing the role of a peacekeeper and good grandfather, and his internal thoughts, which are tumultuous. I enjoyed reading about his creative process, how he considered different approaches to his art, and how he was digging into and untapping his life experiences to try to create better illustrations. I found that the second half of the novel (halves are, indeed, how I choose to think about it, despite it being written in 3 acts with an appendix) much less engaging, starting with the grandson's drawing of the grandfather. The grandfather's big shift in perspective and the big event that follows lacked impact and didn't clearly follow from the intriguing self-discovery that happened in the first half. I think the way the situation between his daughter and son-in-law resolved was really really good, but the grandfather's arc fell flat and left me disappointed.

### The Birds - Tarjei Vesaas t. Michael Barnes & Torbjorn Stoverud
I have no idea what to make of this novel. It's a challenging read which proceeds at a plodding, meandering pace, interspersed with brief gusts of frantic, stressful activity. I was not expecting the ending. Mattis' perspective paints everything in an almost magical light, and it's challenging to constantly recontextualize what he might be experiencing with what others might be experiencing around him. He lives in a world of omens that other people disregard. There's a lot of beauty in his relationship with his sister and in his relationship with the townspeople considering his almost complete inability to communicate his thoughts. It's interesting that Jorgen arrives, unwilling rather than unable to communicate his personal thoughts, as is proper for men, and is accepted immediately. Mattis is constantly trying to reach out and connect with the people around him and is incapable, despite how nice everyone is to him, and Jorgen's seamless transition into village life is, in a way, heartbreaking. I am left picturing a completely still, silent, lake.

### Cherry - Nico Walker
I liked this novel. Halfway through reading it I started wondering if I wasn't somehow filling my mind up with crud by reading books that aren't in the canon or whatever, which I think has been a nagging thought hanging over me. There are really only so many books you're going to read in your life, does it make sense to sit through the ones that aren't going to enrich it? But I quickly got over that and rationalized that I've read a bunch about people with ennui but nothing contemporary about the experience of someone who doesn't know what they're doing and enlists and comes back and has nothing except a crippling drug addiction. The pacing is really great and I felt how the passage of time changed from the narrator's time before war to during to his return and the tension and speed at which his drug addicted days went by. He's only 25 years old at the end but it feels like time streches out and you've spent years with him and Emily. I've never experienced addiction in the way the narrator does and it's really incredible how subtly and quickly it takes over his entire life. It's very very cool the way this novel develops. Nothing matters and he enlists and serves a year under constant threat of death, develops PTSD, and the time he served didn't matter, and he gets back to the states and nothing matters, and he doesn't somehow miraculously improve. It's a tragic novel but there isn't a clear turning point, just a steady decline from birth.

## TV

### One Piece (Episodes 1-60something)
The best selling manga of all time! Over 800 episodes! Coronavirus wreaking havoc and decimating any upcoming plans and social engagements! A perfect time to jump in. I think its okay so far, it definitely improves as it goes on - the first season has a lot of very slow fights, but it seems like character development starts playing a bigger role as the series develops, and character development is where it shines.

### The New Pope
This show feels stylistically driven to me - I'm sure there are a lot of very intelligent metaphors and parallels between things that happen in the show and biblical stories and cultural myths, but if there were, they were outside my purview. I think the ending for Pius XIII was satisfying but did not enjoy or understand John Paul III's storyline. It's a beautiful show though, and it respects you as a viewer, doesn't clearly spell everything out and leaves a lot of mystery.

### What We Do in the Shadows (First 3 episodes)
I'm lukewarm on this show. It's intentionally very campy but I feel like where it shines is in the characters that fit in contemporarilly, which makes it a bit tricky to watch because the main driver of action seem to be the three anachronistic vampires.

## Music

### Mike Lorenz & Friendz - Mike Lorenz & Friendz
I love jazz covers of rock songs and I love both of the bands being covered here. Jazz feels warm and familiar to me in general, so it's nice for that to be reinforced with interpretations of songs I've listened to a bunch anyway.

### The Drones - The Miller's Daughter
So sick. This is kind of, but not quite, an outtakes album, and it's raw and energetic and I dig it. There are a few different recording sessions on this, my favorite is the second (I think it's the second), with the songs "The Miller's Daughter" and "I Believe". I haven't listened to anything else by The Drones for comparison.

### Violent Femmes - Hallowed Ground
I really like the Violent Femmes! I don't think they get a lot of exposure outside of their self titled debut (which is a really great album!!!) but I've enjoyed everything else I've heard by them - I listened to a few of their more recent tracks (They're still around!!! THEY RELEASED AN ALBUM LAST YEAR!!!) and I think those are really good too! It's not often you run across a band with a 30+ year career where you like their new stuff and their old stuff. That all aside, Hallowed Ground is a fun album. I have a huge soft spot for folk punk and anti folk and the like but that aside, I think they're a really interesting band who do a lot of really unusual stuff sonically and have very cool lyrics. I Hear the Rain is such a cool song. It slows down after the first few punkier tracks but I still think it's a worthwhile listen.

### Okean Elzy - Model
This is a nostalgic album for me - my dad would play music every morning on the weekends and it was a source of constant frustration when I wanted to sleep in as a teenager, but they've also all become very familiar songs and albums. I like listening to it now and I'm not sure how much of that is the comfort of familiarity and how much is the quality of the music. I like this album, and curiously, I find it a little more approachable than other Ukrainian music - I only understand Russian, which is not very similar, but I find Okean Elzy to be a little easier to wrap my head around. I like the tracks "Ya do tebe" and "Vstavai". I like this album more than the other one my dad would play regularly, Gloria.

### The Halo Benders - God Don't Make No Junk
I like this album a lot, it's reminiscent of early Modest Mouse stuff, which makes sense since they were contemporaries, and Doug Marscht and Calvin Johnson both knew about and admired them! I haven't listened to any of Johnson's other work but I like Built to Spill, and I feel like The Halo Benders are in a sweet spot of bringing a lot of ideas together with talented musicians and creating a really unique but familiar and welcoming sound. This is the only band I can think of that has two competing vocal tracks on every song, and it sounds great.

### The Halo Benders - Don't Tell Me Now
Another great album. It has a different energy compared to God Don't Make No Junk but is still fantastic.

### Girlpool - Before the World Was Big
I really like the song Chinatown, and I think this is a very charming album. I like that there aren't any drums and feel like that exclusion, along with the vocal harmonies, make this album stand out in the crowded indie rock scene. I don't really love the lyrics but the guitar and bass lines are groovy and the singing works well with them.

### Girlpool - Powerplant
This album goes in some interesting directions but holds onto a coherent musical core tying it together and is a lot of fun to listen to. Powerplant has a sharper and more dynamic sound thanks to the addition of drums (and other backing instruments!) but is still held together with consistent vocals and strong bass and guitar lines. It's more agressive and energetic, but I feel like this is a less memorable album too. I'm not inclined to come back to this over Before the World Was Big.

### Girlpool - What Chaos is Imaginary
I stopped listening to this album halfway through the first time I tried and had to come back to it later. The songs are all kind of different stylistically and the vocalists rotate between tracks making this feel like a spotify playlist more than a coherent album. There is little left that made Girlpool unique and interesting.

### nouns - still bummed
Very hit or miss album. It's a little all over the place stylistically, and some of the songs are a lot worse for the context of the songs around them. There are too many weird electronic sounds for my tastes. I think the eponymous "still bummed" is a great song. I think the album "still" released after this one is really really good, and you can hear a lot of the groundwork for that album here.

### nouns - still
Writing about still bummed made me want to listen to this album, haha. It's a much more coherent album and feels more emotionally charged. You get room to breathe and you get the gamut of upsetting, negative emotions thrown in your face. Great album.
