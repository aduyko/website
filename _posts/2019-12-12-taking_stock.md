It seems a little embarassing to me that I've had this website, where I set up some templates for it to function as a blog, and I haven't taken advantage of that at all. I'm sure a big part of it was that the thought of running a blog seemed a lot more fun than the reality of it - what do you write about? For who? Why? Originally, I wanted to use this space to keep track of books I'd read and movies I'd watched and my thoughts about them. I think it would be nice to actually start doing that, and now's a good time as any.

## Books

### Sentimental Education - Gustave Flaubert
Flaubert is mostly known for Madame Bovary, which I have not read. I do really enjoy the type of classic literature that centers around 19th and 20th century city dwellers going about their 19th and 20th century business - Proust, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, the lot of them. Flaubert was a really beautiful writer and that came across clearly in this book.
That being said, I found it kind of boring. I'm sure that was the intention, to some extent - I believe it was meant to be kind of auto-biographical, and it seems like it was intended to guide you through some of the minutia of being a 19th century aristocrat in Paris, and how that changed with the French Revolution of 1848. While that may be interesting from a historic perspective, I think that 150 years and an entire continent later, I'm a little too detached for it to be as compelling of a story. It seems like Proust executes something similar to this more effectively with his Remembrance of Things Past.

## Movies

### The Lighthouse
I really liked this movie! I like artsy movies, I like movies with a strong aesthetic direction, and I think Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe are great actors. I haven't seen the Eggers brothers' last movie, The Witch, but seeing this has made me want to. I really liked the unstable narration and had no idea what was real and what was a delusion of the characters up until the end. The final scene made me groan a little internally and think "oh, THAT's who the characters represent", but after thinking about it a little bit I think it was great. Super well done movie, and I really appreciated that the writers have given interviews where they've explained some of the symbolism and unanswered questions of the movie without giving too much away.

## Plays

### Beetlejuice
My first broadway play! I thought Beetlejuice was a lot of fun, although I missed the Danny Elfman soundtrack from the movie. I liked that it felt like a healthy combination of light-heartedness and seriousness, and the musical numbers and dances were really great. It seemed like they spent a lot of time on exposition, and I wish there was a little more character exploration of the main characters, but maybe they didn't want to stray too far from the source material. A fun, silly show.

## Music

### Soulive - Rubber
My friend Mike P. recommended this album and I enjoyed it. I don't really like the vibraphone in a lot of music, which makes me a little biased against it, but there's something really nice about hearing jazz covers of songs you know. I really like the Grant Green cover of A Day in the Life, and this is basically an album in that vein.

### Shellac - The End of Radio
I wasn't sure that this was a kind of live album, compilation album, until I looked at the tracklist. I really like Shellac, I think The End of Radio is a great song, and I think listening to this helped me appreciate Albini's songwriting. There's something really funny and lighthearted about Shellac that I don't think a lot of bands have - for someone with his production chops, it's kind of funny that the songs all have these chugging chords and simple drum backbones, and a lot of the songs themselves are just weird - New Number Order comes to mind, but a lot of the lyrics get really silly. This is a great live album, I think some of the tracks sound way better than the studio album versions (such as the aforementioned The End of Radio).

### Vivaldi, The English Concert, Trevor Pinnock - Four Seasons
Part of me always worries that talking about or listening to classical music seems pretentious. I wasn't sure what I wanted to listen to on my walk home one evening and was thinking about "Winter", and put this album on on Spotify. The grand scale of classical music always leaves an impression on me, and Vivaldi was great at passing expression and emotion to the audience through his work. I felt very inspired listening to this.


I am hoping to keep this kind of thing up as a monthly(?) roundup of things I've read and watched and heard.
