# Notes
Weezer - Just Pinkerton, and I think it's very sad that Rivers Cuomo started writing music like a robot after people didn't like Pinkerton when it came out  
Inside Voices - This band rule and would be an easy S except I think their lyrics are really dumb  
Blink-182 - Just their S/T, they're one of my favorite bands but they're a pop punk band
