Here's what I think of every single emo/emo-adjacent band. Emo is hard to really pin down as a genre but the best description I've seen has been "Indie Punk." This is obviously a subjective list, but I think it's worth mentioning that I buy into Dylan of 100 gecs' music rating metric:

> Dylan’s metric for what is a good song is so great. You can be like, “I don’t know if I love that song” or whatever. And Dylan’s like, “if you were listening to this on a huge sound system and your friend made it and you were hearing it, you wouldn't be like, ‘wow, this is great?’”

If any of my friends were in any of these bands I would think it was the best music on Earth.

Tiers are:  
S: "This is incredible" has crossed my mind while listening to these bands or they have otherwise moved me in some way  
A: I like these bands a lot  
B: I think these bands are fine but don't stand out, or I think they're good but not lined up with my tastes  
C: I don't like these bands  
F: Reserved for music that I think is poisonous to listen to

# Notes
Panic! At The Disco - Their debut release is really really good but I can't condone Brendon Urie's musical direction afterwards  
Coheed and Cambria - Just The Second State Turbine Blade - I think their later releases aren't very emo and are more proggy, and they are much better as a prog band than as an emo band.  
Blowout - I want to call this band indie rock. It's a tough call.
