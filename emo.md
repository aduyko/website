Emo is hard to really pin down but the best description I've ever read has been "Indie Punk"  
Bands are ranked based on my favorite album of theirs but there are some exceptions  
I don't pay a lot of attention to lyrics  
Bands are alphabetical within a tier  

Tiers are:  
S: "This is incredible" has crossed my mind while listening to these bands or they have otherwise moved me in some way  
A: I like these bands a lot  
B: I think these bands are fine but don't stand out, or I think they're good but not lined up with my tastes  
C: I don't like these bands  
F: Reserved for music that I think is poisonous to listen to

# Notes
Inside Voices - This band rule and would be an easy S except I think their lyrics are dumb  
Panic! At The Disco - Their debut release is really really good but I can't condone Brendon Urie's musical direction afterwards  
Coheed and Cambria - Just The Second State Turbine Blade - I think their later releases aren't very emo and are more proggy, and they are much better as a prog band than as an emo band.  
Blowout - I want to call this band indie rock. It's a tough call.
