# Notes
Weezer - Just Pinkerton, and I think it's very sad that Rivers Cuomo started writing music like a robot after people didn't like Pinkerton when it came out
Blink-182  - one of my absolute favorite bands but I dunno, looking at them only as an emo band they're just ok
AGBPOL - I these guys are just indie rock and not very emo at all. I don't like them regardless
