Emo is hard to really pin down but the best description I've ever read has been "Indie Punk"  
Bands are ranked based on my favorite album of theirs but there are some exceptions  
I don't pay a lot of attention to lyrics  
Bands are alphabetical within a tier  

Tiers are:  
S: "This is incredible" has crossed my mind while listening to these bands or they have otherwise moved me in some way  
A: I like these bands a lot  
B: I think these bands are fine, or I think they're good but not lined up with my tastes  
C: I don't like these bands  
F: Reserved for music that I think is poisonous to listen to

# Notes
Weezer - Just Pinkerton, and I think it's very sad that Rivers Cuomo started writing music like a robot after people didn't like Pinkerton when it came out  
Inside Voices - This band rule and would be an easy S except I think their lyrics are dumb  
Blink-182 - Just their S/T, they're one of my favorite bands but they're a pop punk band  
Panic! At The Disco - Their debut release is really really good but I can't condone Brendon Urie's musical direction afterwards

# Worth Mentioning

I don't think these bands make sense to put in this ranking

- 17Â° Below (pop punk)
- SeeYouSpaceCowboy (too sass-y)
- Soulside (not emo, later stuff seems just post-hardcore)
